      Preview: Crewai vs. LangGraph: Multi agent framework comparison | Zams Integrations Customers Pricing Blog Login Login Get Started Get Started Technology April 19, 2025 Crewai vs. LangGraph: Which multi agent framework should you use? Yaagneshwaran Ganesh Objective feature comparison to help you decide - based on features, benefits, and ideal use cases. While there are different ways to build an AI agent from scratch, it’s great that you are taking the efficient approach of using multi agent frameworks. You’re probably here because you’ve shortlisted Crew ai and LangGraph and want to decide which one is right for you. You’re in the right place. In this blog, we will compare the two in detail - on their features, benefits, and ideal use cases, including how agents connect to establish communication and interoperability. To get started, we need to have a basic understanding of multi agent systems. So, let’s first get a few basics out of the way. Why do you need a multi-agent framework? As your AI systems scale and you add multiple agents with different capabilities, the complexity of these applications grow. As the complexity grows, you will need a structured environment that orchestrates the agent activities, including the technical steps and requirements involved in building agents. That is where agentic frameworks come in. Multi agent frameworks provide you with a foundational structure for developing autonomous systems, and define parameters and protocols to handle interactions between multiple specialized agents. These frameworks also incorporate agent actions, which are fundamental components within a node-based AI framework, facilitating the execution of complex tasks. An agentic application can significantly enhance user experience and system efficiency by streamlining user interaction through minimal input and adaptive responses. Single agent systems These systems are autonomous but rely on one agent to handle a wide range of tasks, like a jack of all trades. For example, here’s how it works when requested for a sales pipeline report: As you can see, one agent carries out a series of tasks to accomplish the requested outcome. Single agent systems are great for specialized tasks where the problem is well defined and the scope is limited. But as your environment and context evolves, they fall short. Multi agent systems Multi agent systems, on the contrary, consist of multiple AI agents working together to achieve common goals. Let’s look at the same example of requesting to email the sales report, and see how the multi agent architecture manages specialized agents to execute it. Instead of one agent accomplishing all the tasks, the tasks are broken down into smaller components where each agent specializes in a specific task – such as planning, integrating, analyzing, and more like a team of specialists working together, where each brings their unique expertise to the table. And because these AI agents can collaborate dynamically and run these tasks in parallel, they can tackle more complex problems where the environment is always changing and evolving. Multi agent interactions allow these AI agents to communicate within the system, monitor and debug in real-time, and handle handoffs efficiently, enabling dynamic workflows. The better you understand how these multi agents interact, the better you can optimize these systems and scale your operations, without worrying about bottlenecks or performance issues. And that’s exactly what multi agent frameworks help you with. Additionally, these frameworks give you a set of pre-packaged tools and features to help you quickly build any type of agent systems, be it knowledge oriented, process oriented or predictive. In short, agentic frameworks are the backbone of scalable, efficient and autonomous AI operations. With that said let’s get to the comparison. What is Crewai? It is an open-source multi agent orchestration framework, that helps you build multi agent systems, and integrate them with the latest LLMs and your codebase. The framework automates multi-agent workflows, enables them to communicate and collaborate on tasks as a team, and make decisions autonomously. Their modular design includes a range of tools such as agents, tools, tasks, processes, and an agent development kit, to engage, collect information, handle complex tasks, and manage their operations through tool calls. Crew’s hierarchical process generates a supervisor agent to oversee task execution and agent coordination. The agent engine facilitates the transition from prototype to production by managing various complexities including infrastructure, security, and performance evaluation, while integrating seamlessly with existing frameworks. With asynchronous tool execution, agents can work on different business processes concurrently, increasing productivity. Crew is primarily designed for research and quick prototypes. What is LangGraph framework (by LangChain)? LangGraph is an open-source AI framework to develop, deploy and manage advanced workflows for generative AI agents. Using graph-based architecture LangGraph handles the relationships between different components of the AI workflow. LangGraph applications offer robust features like scalable infrastructure and self-hosted deployment options that enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead. Built on LangChain, a Python framework for AI applications, LangGraph excels at managing large language models. Function calling is integral to enhancing the capabilities of AI applications, particularly when combined with structured outputs and fine-tuning techniques. The LangGraph platform provides various deployment options, including self-hosted solutions, cloud SaaS, and the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) option, catering to different user needs and preferences. With LangGraph Studio, a visual interface to develop workflows, users can reduce coding. One of LangGraph’s key features is its state management system which acts like a memory bank, storing information and enabling better state management and debugging. Users can run LangGraph Platform entirely on their own infrastructure as part of a Self-Hosted Enterprise solution, allowing companies to maintain control over their data while outsourcing the management of some services. The integrated development environment in LangGraph Studio is specifically tailored for AI agent development, offering powerful tools for visualization, real-time interaction, and debugging, which enhances the overall development experience for users working with agent workflows. This is crucial for graph execution as it allows managing individual agents as graph nodes in the system. LangGraph supports a human-in-the-loop approach, so human input can enhance AI decision making and user interactions. LangGraph is primarily designed for engineering teams and production. Architecture and design philosophy Architecture and design of agent frameworks play a huge role in determining their effectiveness to support development of complex AI applications. A well-designed framework ideally provides a modular and flexible structure, allowing you to easily integrate various components and tools. Additionally, the framework should support seamless interaction between multiple agents, making it easy to build sophisticated workflows and applications. Crewai agents approach Crew is an agent framework that adopts a collaborative intelligence approach, helping you create multi-agent systems where specialized agents work together to achieve shared objectives. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic task allocation, large language models, and multi-agent orchestration. LangGraph agents framework LangGraph is an agent framework that takes a state-centric approach, providing a graph-based architecture to enable creation of complex workflows and applications.

      • When architecting for 2025, the choice between LangGraph vs CrewAI is a trade-off between Velocity and Control.  ### The Hybrid Approach: "Crews as Nodes"  An emerging pattern involves nesting CrewAI within LangGraph.   Architecture: The outer “Skeleton” of the application is a robust LangGraph StateMachine. It handles database connections, API routing, and error handling.  The “Creative” Node: One specific node in the graph (e.g., “Brainstorm\_Node”) instantiates a temporary CrewAI object.

      • For CrewAI, since the current process model is sequential, you might have, say, 3–10 agents each with their task in a pipeline, but not truly all active at once. CrewAI is well-suited for a moderate number of agents in a team — perhaps a “crew” of a half-dozen specialized roles is a reasonable upper bound before the process gets too unwieldy. LangGraph can orchestrate many agents because of its graph structure. If needed, you could design a graph with dozens of nodes (each node could represent [...] CrewAI implements a comprehensive memory system comparable to LangGraph’s. Each agent can have memory of past interactions or knowledge relevant to its role. Because tasks are typically one-off in a sequence, memory in CrewAI often means that an agent can recall what it discussed in its portion of the workflow. For example, if the Researcher agent finds facts in Task1, the Writer agent in Task2 can be given those facts (from Task1 output) as context — effectively short-term memory transfer. [...] Each node’s execution can be seen as an event: the node function is called with the current state, it may call an LLM or tool, then it produces an output (updates to state or a Command). That output determines the next event (which node to execute next). LangGraph is capable of parallel execution if the graph has parallel branches (using task queues and worker processes as hinted by its horizontal scaling support), but commonly workflows are defined as DAGs that are executed stepwise.

We’ve moved beyond the phase of simple “Chat with Data” (RAG) and one-off prompts into a new era: Agentic Orchestration . AI is no longer just about generating a single response from a Large Language Model (LLM). Instead, modern systems rely on multi-step workflows that involve reasoning, using tools, managing state, and coordinating multiple specialized AI agents working together. For engineering leaders and enterprise teams, this shift has created two dominant approaches to building these systems: CrewAI and LangGraph . CrewAI has become the go-to framework for fast prototyping. It works like a digital version of a human team–where “Researchers,” “Analysts,” and “Managers” each have goals and backstories. This role-playing style makes it incredibly easy to build multi-agent systems quickly. But when these prototypes are pushed into real production environments, they often hit a “complexity wall.” Problems like unpredictable loops, cluttered context windows, and unclear inter-agent communication make scalability and reliability difficult, especially under strict SLAs. LangGraph , on the other hand, is built for production from day one. Instead of relying on human-like metaphors, it uses a structured, engineering-friendly model based on Graph Theory and State Machines . By defining each step as a node and each path as an edge, LangGraph offers precise control, built-in looping, and checkpointing for reliability. It may take longer to set up initially, but the payoff is a system that is far easier to maintain, debug, and scale in enterprise environments. This comprehensive article serves as a strategic and technical manual for navigating the transition from CrewAI prototypes to LangGraph production systems, giving a detailed analysis on LangGraph vs CrewAI comparison. It provides: Deep Technical Analysis : A granular comparison of the architectural underpinnings of both frameworks. Why Prototypes Fail: Explains common reasons why AI prototypes that work in testing break in real-world use, like delays in agent coordination or runaway costs. How to Transition : A clear, step-by-step guide to update older CrewAI systems and turn them into reliable LangGraph production setups. Making It Work in the Real World : Tips for monitoring performance, controlling costs, and working with Generative AI expertise to successfully deploy your AI systems at scale. The Agentic Landscape in 2025: From Novelty to Infrastructure To understand why the choice between LangGraph vs CrewAI matters, one must first appreciate the rapid evolution of the &#8220;Agent&#8221; as a software primitive. The Evolution of Cognitive Architectures In 2023, the industry focused on &#8220;Chains&#8221;—linear sequences of LLM calls (Input → Prompt → LLM → Output). While deterministic, chains lacked agency; they could not adapt to unexpected inputs or failures. In 2024, the focus shifted to &#8220;Loops&#8221; and &#8220;Autonomous Agents&#8221; (like AutoGPT and BabyAGI). These systems could reason and retry, but they were often chaotic and difficult to control. In 2025, the standard is Structured Orchestration . We now acknowledge that &#8220;autonomy&#8221; is not a binary state but a spectrum. Production systems require &#8220;Bounded Agency&#8221;—agents that are free to reason within a tightly defined problem space but are constrained by rigid architectural guardrails. This shift has driven the adoption of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The consensus is that decomposing a complex problem (e.g., &#8220;Conduct a Due Diligence Audit&#8221;) into specialized sub-agents (e.g., &#8220;Financial Analyst,&#8221; &#8220;Legal Reviewer,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Assessor&#8221;) yields superior performance compared to a single monolithic model. Specialized agents can utilize smaller, fine-tuned models, specific toolsets, and distinct system prompts to reduce hallucinations and improve focus. The "Valley of Death" in Agent Development A critical phenomenon observed in the 2024-2025 cycle is the &#8220;Valley of Death&#8221; for AI projects. This refers to the high failure rate of agentic applications moving from a local Jupyter Notebook to a Kubernetes production cluster. The Prototype : Runs on a developer’s laptop, with everything happening quickly and under direct human supervision. It works like magic in this controlled environment. The Production System : Runs in the cloud without constant human oversight. It has to handle network delays, API limits, multiple users at once, and cost constraints. What Changes in Production: The “magic” often breaks. Delays can make agents stall or give wrong responses, and important instructions can get lost in long conversations between agents. This is why frameworks like CrewAI, which focus on ease of use, can struggle in production, while LangGraph, which focuses on control and reliability, performs better. Deep Dive into CrewAI — The Master of Rapid Prototyping CrewAI revolutionized the agentic space by introducing a mental model that anyone could understand: The Digital Workforce. Architectural Philosophy: Role-Playing as Code CrewAI&#8217;s core architecture is built around the anthropomorphization of software functions. It assum... [truncated]

These differences affect how developers design, manage, and scale their systems, and understanding them is essential before making a choice.   Let’s break down these differences across several important dimensions, starting with architecture.  ### Architectural differences
      • So, in case of LangGraph, more effort is needed for the initial set up and configuration, and comes with a steeper learning curve.  ### 2. Scalability  #### Crewai: Designed for research  It can scale well and handle a moderate number of agents and task-based workflows, however, conditional logic within workflows can be tricky. Crewai agents are a better fit when independent agents don’t need to constantly talk to each other, and not for real-time interaction-heavy use cases. [...] LangGraph is an open-source AI framework to develop, deploy and manage advanced workflows for generative AI agents. Using graph-based architecture LangGraph handles the relationships between different components of the AI workflow.  LangGraph applications offer robust features like scalable infrastructure and self-hosted deployment options that enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead.

      Preview: Crewai vs. LangGraph: Multi agent framework comparison | Zams Integrations Customers Pricing Blog Login Login Get Started Get Started Technology April 19, 2025 Crewai vs. LangGraph: Which multi agent framework should you use? Yaagneshwaran Ganesh Objective feature comparison to help you decide - based on features, benefits, and ideal use cases. While there are different ways to build an AI agent from scratch, it’s great that you are taking the efficient approach of using multi agent frameworks. You’re probably here because you’ve shortlisted Crew ai and LangGraph and want to decide which one is right for you. You’re in the right place. In this blog, we will compare the two in detail - on their features, benefits, and ideal use cases, including how agents connect to establish communication and interoperability. To get started, we need to have a basic understanding of multi agent systems. So, let’s first get a few basics out of the way. Why do you need a multi-agent framework? As your AI systems scale and you add multiple agents with different capabilities, the complexity of these applications grow. As the complexity grows, you will need a structured environment that orchestrates the agent activities, including the technical steps and requirements involved in building agents. That is where agentic frameworks come in. Multi agent frameworks provide you with a foundational structure for developing autonomous systems, and define parameters and protocols to handle interactions between multiple specialized agents. These frameworks also incorporate agent actions, which are fundamental components within a node-based AI framework, facilitating the execution of complex tasks. An agentic application can significantly enhance user experience and system efficiency by streamlining user interaction through minimal input and adaptive responses. Single agent systems These systems are autonomous but rely on one agent to handle a wide range of tasks, like a jack of all trades. For example, here’s how it works when requested for a sales pipeline report: As you can see, one agent carries out a series of tasks to accomplish the requested outcome. Single agent systems are great for specialized tasks where the problem is well defined and the scope is limited. But as your environment and context evolves, they fall short. Multi agent systems Multi agent systems, on the contrary, consist of multiple AI agents working together to achieve common goals. Let’s look at the same example of requesting to email the sales report, and see how the multi agent architecture manages specialized agents to execute it. Instead of one agent accomplishing all the tasks, the tasks are broken down into smaller components where each agent specializes in a specific task – such as planning, integrating, analyzing, and more like a team of specialists working together, where each brings their unique expertise to the table. And because these AI agents can collaborate dynamically and run these tasks in parallel, they can tackle more complex problems where the environment is always changing and evolving. Multi agent interactions allow these AI agents to communicate within the system, monitor and debug in real-time, and handle handoffs efficiently, enabling dynamic workflows. The better you understand how these multi agents interact, the better you can optimize these systems and scale your operations, without worrying about bottlenecks or performance issues. And that’s exactly what multi agent frameworks help you with. Additionally, these frameworks give you a set of pre-packaged tools and features to help you quickly build any type of agent systems, be it knowledge oriented, process oriented or predictive. In short, agentic frameworks are the backbone of scalable, efficient and autonomous AI operations. With that said let’s get to the comparison. What is Crewai? It is an open-source multi agent orchestration framework, that helps you build multi agent systems, and integrate them with the latest LLMs and your codebase. The framework automates multi-agent workflows, enables them to communicate and collaborate on tasks as a team, and make decisions autonomously. Their modular design includes a range of tools such as agents, tools, tasks, processes, and an agent development kit, to engage, collect information, handle complex tasks, and manage their operations through tool calls. Crew’s hierarchical process generates a supervisor agent to oversee task execution and agent coordination. The agent engine facilitates the transition from prototype to production by managing various complexities including infrastructure, security, and performance evaluation, while integrating seamlessly with existing frameworks. With asynchronous tool execution, agents can work on different business processes concurrently, increasing productivity. Crew is primarily designed for research and quick prototypes. What is LangGraph framework (by LangChain)? LangGraph is an open-source AI framework to develop, deploy and manage advanced workflows for generative AI agents. Using graph-based architecture LangGraph handles the relationships between different components of the AI workflow. LangGraph applications offer robust features like scalable infrastructure and self-hosted deployment options that enhance workflow management and processing without adding overhead. Built on LangChain, a Python framework for AI applications, LangGraph excels at managing large language models. Function calling is integral to enhancing the capabilities of AI applications, particularly when combined with structured outputs and fine-tuning techniques. The LangGraph platform provides various deployment options, including self-hosted solutions, cloud SaaS, and the Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) option, catering to different user needs and preferences. With LangGraph Studio, a visual interface to develop workflows, users can reduce coding. One of LangGraph’s key features is its state management system which acts like a memory bank, storing information and enabling better state management and debugging. Users can run LangGraph Platform entirely on their own infrastructure as part of a Self-Hosted Enterprise solution, allowing companies to maintain control over their data while outsourcing the management of some services. The integrated development environment in LangGraph Studio is specifically tailored for AI agent development, offering powerful tools for visualization, real-time interaction, and debugging, which enhances the overall development experience for users working with agent workflows. This is crucial for graph execution as it allows managing individual agents as graph nodes in the system. LangGraph supports a human-in-the-loop approach, so human input can enhance AI decision making and user interactions. LangGraph is primarily designed for engineering teams and production. Architecture and design philosophy Architecture and design of agent frameworks play a huge role in determining their effectiveness to support development of complex AI applications. A well-designed framework ideally provides a modular and flexible structure, allowing you to easily integrate various components and tools. Additionally, the framework should support seamless interaction between multiple agents, making it easy to build sophisticated workflows and applications. Crewai agents approach Crew is an agent framework that adopts a collaborative intelligence approach, helping you create multi-agent systems where specialized agents work together to achieve shared objectives. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic task allocation, large language models, and multi-agent orchestration. LangGraph agents framework LangGraph is an agent framework that takes a state-centric approach, providing a graph-based architecture to enable creation of complex workflows and applications. This approach is ideal for applications requiring sophisticated state management, kno... [truncated]

      ## Detailed Information
      
      **Overview**
      CrewAI and LangGraph are frameworks used for orchestrating multi-agent systems, but they emphasize different aspects of development [1], [3]. CrewAI focuses on simple orchestration and a role-based workflow [1], [3], while LangGraph prioritizes fine-grained control and modular execution through a graph-based architecture [1], [3]. The choice between them depends on the desired level of control versus speed of development [1].
      
      **Architecture and Approach**
      *   **CrewAI:** Employs a role-based model, visualizing workflows as teamwork [1], [3]. Scales through horizontal agent replication and task parallelization within role hierarchies [1].
      *   **LangGraph:** Utilizes a graph-based orchestration for modular and conditional execution [1], [3]. It manages application state through a central persistence layer and scales through distributed graph execution and parallel node processing [1]. LangGraph is integrated into the LangChain ecosystem, leveraging its integrations and LangSmith observability [1].
      
      **Scalability and Complexity**
      CrewAI is well-suited for a moderate number of agents (3-10) [1]. While CrewAI can scale and handle task-based workflows, conditional logic can be tricky [1]. CrewAI agents are appropriate when independent agents don’t need to constantly communicate, and are not ideal for real-time interaction-heavy use cases [1]. LangGraph is better suited for orchestrating many agents due to its graph structure [1]. LangGraph requires more initial setup and has a steeper learning curve [1].
      
      **Hybrid Approach**
      A hybrid approach involves nesting CrewAI within LangGraph, where LangGraph handles core functionalities and a 'creative' node instantiates a temporary CrewAI object [1].
      
      **Community & Adoption**
      CrewAI launched earlier than LangGraph (Nov 2023 vs Jan 2024) [1]. CrewAI has a larger fanbase on GitHub (33k stars vs LangGraph’s 15k) [1]. LangGraph shows a faster development velocity (5,800+ commits vs CrewAI’s 1,520) and leads in monthly downloads (~6.17M) compared to CrewAI (~1.38M), indicating broader adoption [1].
      
      **Flexibility and Control**
      The structured memory architecture of CrewAI may be less flexible than LangGraph's customizable approach [1]. The reliance on SQLite3 for long-term memory may limit scalability in high-throughput applications [1]. CrewAI sparks creativity and accelerates prototyping, while LangGraph provides the control, durability, and observability necessary for enterprise-scale deployments [1].

CrewAI는 LangGraph보다 먼저 출시되었다 (2023년 11월 대 2024년 1월) [1]. CrewAI는 GitHub에서 더 많은 팬층을 보유하고 있다 (33k 스타 대 LangGraph의 15k) [1]. LangGraph는 더 빠른 개발 속도 (5,800개 이상의 커밋 대 CrewAI의 1,520개)를 보이며, 월별 다운로드 수 (~6.17M)에서 CrewAI (~1.38M)보다 앞서 더 넓은 채택률을 나타낸다 [1].

**유연성 및 제어:**

CrewAI의 구조화된 메모리 아키텍처는 LangGraph의 사용자 정의 가능한 접근 방식보다 유연성이 떨어질 수 있다 [1]. 장기 메모리를 위한 SQLite3에 대한 의존성은 높은 처리량 애플리케이션에서 확장성을 제한할 수 있다 [1]. CrewAI는 창의성을 촉진하고 프로토타입 제작을 가속화하는 반면, LangGraph는 엔터프라이즈 규모의 배포에 필요한 제어, 내구성 및 관찰 가능성을 제공한다 [1].

## 결론 및 평가

CrewAI와 LangGraph는 모두 강력한 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축 도구이지만, 각각의 강점과 약점이 명확하다. 간단하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 제작하고 싶거나, 역할 기반 팀워크 모델을 선호한다면 CrewAI가 적합하다. 반면, 복잡한 워크플로우를 세밀하게 제어하고 LangChain 생태계를 활용하며, 엔터프라이즈 수준의 안정성과 확장성을 확보하고 싶다면 LangGraph가 더 나은 선택일 수 있다. 두 프레임워크의 장점을 결합한 하이브리드 접근 방식 또한 고려해볼 만하다. 궁극적으로 어떤 프레임워크를 선택할지는 프로젝트의 구체적인 요구 사항과 개발팀의 숙련도에 따라 결정해야 한다.

      • Readers will gain a comprehensive overview of LLM-based Multi-Agent (LLM-MA) systems, grasp the fundamental concepts involved in establishing multi-agent systems based on LLMs, and catch the latest research trends and applica-tions in this dynamic field. We recognize that this field is in its early stages and is rapidly evolving with fresh methodolo-gies and applications. To provide a sustainable resource com-plementing our survey paper, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository1. We hope [...] We expect that our survey can make significant contribu-tions to both the research and development of LLMs and to arXiv:2402.01680v2 [cs.CL] 19 Apr 2024 Figure 1: The rising trend in the research field of LLM-based Multi-Agents. For Problem Solving and World Simulation, we categorize current work into several categories and count the number of papers of different types at 3-month intervals. The number at each leaf node denotes the count of papers within that category. [...] The vol-ume of research papers is rapidly increasing, as shown in Fig. 1 (inspired by the design in [Gao et al., 2023b]), thus broadening the impact of LLM-based Multi-Agent research.

If a couple of years ago we talked about some new AI chatbots that can answer questions for customer support purposes, today - we discuss agents for artificial intelligence , their huge possibilities, features, structures, etc. According to Forester , AI startups received $12.2 billion in funding across over 1,100 deals only during Q1 2024, reflecting continued investor confidence in AI's transformative potential. Additionally, as businesses use more AI agents , 39% of companies predict an increase in workforce size due to new roles supporting AI initiatives, while 51% of employees anticipate AI will positively impact their jobs within five years. These numbers are impressive but what is even more impressive is that AI agents can combine into multiple systems - called multi agent or multi AI agent. In this article, we will describe the basics of multi agent systems in artificial intelligence, their capabilities, examples and the ways to build agents and multi agent systems. Are you ready? Let’s move on. Multi AI Agents And Multiagent Systems - What Are They? Multi AI Agents are systems that are based on many agents connected to similar or different Large Language Models. In contrast to regular single-agent models, multi agent systems in artificial intelligence allow these autonomous agents to handle complex, multifaceted tasks more effectively, by sharing responsibilities and coordinating with each other. This multi agent architecture offers a unique advantage for applications that require adaptability and precision, showcasing the capabilities of multi agent artificial intelligence. As we may see from the schema above, the core components of the multi AI agent are: Agents - agents are built with distinct roles, personas, and specific contexts in mind, allowing them to operate within a multi agent system. Each agent uses LLM for processing, enabling it to perform specialized tasks with precision. Agents Managing - it outlines how these agents collaborate, whether through sequential, hierarchical, or bi-directional communication patterns. This coordination is key for multi agent optimization, allowing agents to respond dynamically to task requirements. Human in the loop - having a human in the loop is essential to support decision-making and assess results. This human oversight complements the autonomous capabilities of agents, providing the reliability of the multi agent system. Tool - agents are equipped with various tools for specific tasks, such as searching the web for information, reading or generating documents, or uploading code to repositories. These tools amplify the versatility of multi agent artificial intelligence, enabling it to handle complex tasks. LLM - each agent’s actions are supported by language model, which provide the inference required to interpret and generate responses. This LLM backbone is fundamental to the functionality of the multi agent system, guiding each agent’s contributions to the collective process. Context - the context is a set of information that is defined by a prompt so it may recognize intent and react. These prompts are used by AI algorithms integrated into the agents to act specially. The core structure of multi agent systems in artificial intelligence enables each agent to operate either independently or as part of a coordinated group, depending on the needs of the task. Despite their autonomy, these agents benefit from human oversight, especially when decisions require review or adjustment in sensitive scenarios. This framework of multi agent vs single agent operation allows flexibility, where agents can switch between collaboration and independent action, creating a multiagent system that is versatile for multiple industries. In practice, agents within a multi agent system use various tools to complete their assignments, such as performing online searches or processing complex documents. With multi agent LLM capabilities, these systems bring together autonomous agents to tackle diverse challenges, transforming approaches to problem-solving across industries by using the strengths of multi agent and single agent models together. Does this seem a bit too complex for you? Feel free to contact us and our AI experts will provide a consultation for you on how multi-agents work and their way to benefit your business. How Multi-Agent LLMs Work Multi agent LLMs are developed to function as a collaborative network of both open-source and closed-source language models, where each agent is assigned a specialized task that it can perform with expertise. The research interest in LLM-based multi-agent systems is rapidly growing, especially for problem-solving and world simulation applications. Please look at this LLM tree prepared by multiple universities working with multi-agents. To track progress, the AI scientists categorized recent work into various types and tallied the number of publications in each category at three-month intervals. Each leaf node displays the count of papers within its specific category. In a multi agent LLM system, the typical workflow starts when a user provides a high-level task or query. The multi agent system then decomposes this task into smaller, manageable subtasks, which are assigned to different specialized agents within the multi agent architecture. Each agent, equipped with unique capabilities, tackles its designated subtask using its LLM to reason, plan, and take action. These agents work within autonomous agents and multi agent systems, interacting as necessary to share information and complete subtasks that rely on collaboration. This structure highlights the difference between multi agent vs single agent approaches, showcasing the benefits of cooperative problem-solving in multi agent systems in artificial intelligence. The system coordinates multi agent optimization and appropriate connection with LLM API. The general workflow on multi-agent LLMs may look like this: Once all agents have completed their tasks, the outputs are collected and combined into a cohesive final result. This seamless assembly within the multiagent system allows for complex, multi-layered tasks to be handled efficiently. Such processes illustrate the power and adaptability of multi agent LLMs, which harnesses the strengths of individual agents to address challenges that require a collaborative and scalable approach. Multi AI Agents vs Single AI Agents Multi agent systems in artificial intelligence are particularly effective for complex tasks due to their collaborative nature. Unlike single-agent models, which operate independently, autonomous agents and multi agent systems coordinate their strengths to tackle different challenges. This cooperation helps mitigate common problems such as hallucinations in LLMs, where single-agent models might generate convincing but false information. By having agents cross-check each other's outputs, these systems reduce inaccuracies, making them reliable for critical areas like pharmacy &amp; healthcare o... [truncated]

From its early days as rule-based systems to today’s advanced neural networks, AI has dramatically shifted its capabilities. The leap from simple predictive models to powerful generative AI has opened doors to a world of unprecedented opportunities. At the forefront of this revolution are Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA, which have brought us closer to mimicking human cognition by enabling machines to reason, generate human-like text, write complex code, and summarize vast volumes of information at an unprecedented scale. However, despite their enormous potential, LLMs are not without limitations. While they excel in generating text, solving individual problems, or producing content in a highly contextual manner, they face challenges when it comes to executing complex, multi-step tasks that require coordination across several domains. Tasks that involve real-time decision-making, multi-agent collaboration, and continuous adaptation often lead to gaps in performance and efficiency when handled solely by a single LLM. This is where the power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) comes into play. MAS, a field rooted deeply in distributed AI, robotics, and complex systems, involves multiple intelligent agents working collaboratively to achieve tasks that are too complex for a single entity to handle alone. Each agent in an MAS can have different capabilities, specialized knowledge, or focus areas. These agents communicate, collaborate, and solve problems collectively, often achieving remarkable results that would be difficult for any one agent or individual to accomplish. When combined with LLMs, MAS becomes something far more powerful—an intelligent, dynamic network of reasoning agents capable of coordinating, specializing, and solving problems in ways that mimic and even exceed human teamwork. In 2025, we’ve reached a pivotal point in the integration of LLMs and MAS. The convergence of these technologies has given rise to a new and highly influential architecture: LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) . These systems represent a scalable, modular, and flexible framework capable of addressing real-world problems that single LLMs often struggle to solve reliably. Whether it’s streamlining enterprise automation, solving intricate scientific research problems, or improving customer service workflows, LLM-MAS offers a new level of efficiency, intelligence, and adaptability. LLM-MAS integrates the reasoning and generation capabilities of LLMs with the coordination and execution strengths of multi-agent systems. Imagine a scenario where a team of specialized agents, powered by LLMs, works in tandem to analyze, plan, execute, and adjust strategies based on real-time data. Such systems can break down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks and distribute them across specialized agents who work independently or in collaboration to achieve a common goal. This groundbreaking combination brings several key benefits: Scalability and Flexibility : LLM-MAS frameworks are inherently modular, allowing for easy scalability and adaptation to a variety of industries, from healthcare to finance to logistics. Task Specialization : With specialized agents handling different aspects of a task, such as planning, execution, error correction, and data analysis, LLM-MAS can tackle more complex, nuanced problems than a single LLM could manage on its own. Real-time Adaptation and Coordination : These systems can adapt dynamically to new information and changing conditions, ensuring that decisions are made based on the most up-to-date context available. Distributed Problem Solving : Multi-agent collaboration increases efficiency by allowing agents to operate in parallel, thereby speeding up problem-solving and decision-making. However, integrating LLMs with MAS is not without its challenges. One key difficulty lies in ensuring seamless communication and coordination between agents. Since each agent may be working on different sub-tasks or operating in different environments, aligning their efforts and maintaining a cohesive strategy can be complex. Additionally, ensuring the robustness and reliability of these systems, especially in high-stakes environments like autonomous vehicles or financial forecasting, requires addressing concerns around fault tolerance, security, and ethical decision-making. Despite these challenges, the potential of LLM-MAS is undeniable. As AI continues to evolve, these systems will likely become integral to industries that rely on complex decision-making and real-time responses. Businesses that adopt LLM-MAS architectures will be able to automate intricate processes, reduce human error, improve efficiency, and unlock new levels of innovation in their operations. In this blog, we will explore how LLMs and MAS can work together to revolutionize industries. We’ll dive into the key technologies and frameworks enabling this evolution, discuss the benefits and challenges of LLM-MAS, and provide a roadmap for implementation. Whether you’re a CTO, AI engineer, or tech decision-maker, understanding how LLMs and multi-agent systems intersect will be crucial in shaping how you deploy intelligent systems in your organization. The future of intelligent systems is here, and it's agentic. By leveraging LLM-MAS, organizations can not only keep pace with technological advancements but also pioneer new solutions to problems that were once thought insurmountable. 1.

      Preview: Everything you need to know about multi AI agents in 2025: explanation, examples and challenges - Springs August 19, 2025 Everything you need to know about multi AI agents in 2025: explanation, examples and challenges Everything you need to know about multi AI agents: explanation, examples, and challenges Written by Serhii Uspenskyi COO AI &amp; ML AI &amp; ML Table of Contents H2 generate H3 generate Intro Step by step, our society is moving into the era of human-like systems that can replace some people’s functions and make it 10 times faster showing even better results. If a couple of years ago we talked about some new AI chatbots that can answer questions for customer support purposes, today - we discuss agents for artificial intelligence , their huge possibilities, features, structures, etc. According to Forester , AI startups received $12.2 billion in funding across over 1,100 deals only during Q1 2024, reflecting continued investor confidence in AI&#x27;s transformative potential. Additionally, as businesses use more AI agents , 39% of companies predict an increase in workforce size due to new roles supporting AI initiatives, while 51% of employees anticipate AI will positively impact their jobs within five years. These numbers are impressive but what is even more impressive is that AI agents can combine into multiple systems - called multi agent or multi AI agent. In this article, we will describe the basics of multi agent systems in artificial intelligence, their capabilities, examples and the ways to build agents and multi agent systems. Are you ready? Let’s move on. Multi AI Agents And Multiagent Systems - What Are They? Multi AI Agents are systems that are based on many agents connected to similar or different Large Language Models . In contrast to regular single-agent models, multi agent systems in artificial intelligence allow these autonomous agents to handle complex, multifaceted tasks more effectively, by sharing responsibilities and coordinating with each other. This multi agent architecture offers a unique advantage for applications that require adaptability and precision, showcasing the capabilities of multi agent artificial intelligence. As we may see from the schema above, the core components of the multi AI agent are: Agents - agents are built with distinct roles, personas, and specific contexts in mind, allowing them to operate within a multi agent system. Each agent uses LLM for processing, enabling it to perform specialized tasks with precision. Agents Managing - it outlines how these agents collaborate, whether through sequential, hierarchical, or bi-directional communication patterns. This coordination is key for multi agent optimization, allowing agents to respond dynamically to task requirements. Human in the loop - having a human in the loop is essential to support decision-making and assess results. This human oversight complements the autonomous capabilities of agents, providing the reliability of the multi agent system. Tool - agents are equipped with various tools for specific tasks, such as searching the web for information, reading or generating documents, or uploading code to repositories. These tools amplify the versatility of multi agent artificial intelligence, enabling it to handle complex tasks. LLM - each agent’s actions are supported by language model, which provide the inference required to interpret and generate responses. This LLM backbone is fundamental to the functionality of the multi agent system, guiding each agent’s contributions to the collective process. Context - the context is a set of information that is defined by a prompt so it may recognize intent and react. These prompts are used by AI algorithms integrated into the agents to act specially. The core structure of multi agent systems in artificial intelligence enables each agent to operate either independently or as part of a coordinated group, depending on the needs of the task. Despite their autonomy, these agents benefit from human oversight, especially when decisions require review or adjustment in sensitive scenarios. This framework of multi agent vs single agent operation allows flexibility, where agents can switch between collaboration and independent action, creating a multiagent system that is versatile for multiple industries. In practice, agents within a multi agent system use various tools to complete their assignments, such as performing online searches or processing complex documents. With multi agent LLM capabilities, these systems bring together autonomous agents to tackle diverse challenges, transforming approaches to problem-solving across industries by using the strengths of multi agent and single agent models together. Does this seem a bit too complex for you? Feel free to contact us and our AI experts will provide a consultation for you on how multi-agents work and their way to benefit your business. How Multi-Agent LLMs Work Multi agent LLMs are developed to function as a collaborative network of both open-source and closed-source language models , where each agent is assigned a specialized task that it can perform with expertise. The research interest in LLM-based multi-agent systems is rapidly growing, especially for problem-solving and world simulation applications. Please look at this LLM tree prepared by multiple universities working with multi-agents. To track progress, the AI scientists categorized recent work into various types and tallied the number of publications in each category at three-month intervals. Each leaf node displays the count of papers within its specific category. In a multi agent LLM system, the typical workflow starts when a user provides a high-level task or query. The multi agent system then decomposes this task into smaller, manageable subtasks, which are assigned to different specialized agents within the multi agent architecture. Each agent, equipped with unique capabilities, tackles its designated subtask using its LLM to reason, plan, and take action. These agents work within autonomous agents and multi agent systems, interacting as necessary to share information and complete subtasks that rely on collaboration. This structure highlights the difference between multi agent vs single agent approaches, showcasing the benefits of cooperative problem-solving in multi agent systems in artificial intelligence. The system coordinates multi agent optimization and appropriate connection with LLM API . The general workflow on multi-agent LLMs may look like this: Once all agents have completed their tasks, the outputs are collected and combined into a cohesive final result. This seamless assembly within the multiagent system allows for complex, multi-layered tasks to be handled efficiently. Such processes illustrate the power and adaptability of multi agent LLMs, which harnesses the strengths of individual agents to address challenges that require a collaborative and scalable approach. Multi AI Agents vs Single AI Agents Multi agent systems in artificial intelligence are particularly effective for complex tasks due to their collaborative nature. Unlike single-agent models, which operate independently, autonomous agents and multi agent systems coordinate their strengths to tackle different challenges. This cooperation helps mitigate common problems such as hallucinations in LLMs, where single-agent models might generate convincing but false information. By having agents cross-check each other&#x27;s outputs, these systems reduce inaccuracies, making them reliable for critical areas like pharmacy &amp; healthcare or legal &amp; compliance . A significant advantage of a multi agent architecture is its ability to manage extended contexts. While single-agent systems face limitations due to small context windows, multi-agent setups overcome this by distributing segments of long texts among agents. Each agent processes part of the information, and together they maintain a continuous understanding of th... [truncated]

Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more adaptive real-world behavior. This paper comprehensively examines the evolution of agent systems from the pre-LLM era to current LLM-powered architectures. We categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial trading, and healthcare. We further discuss the primary challenges posed by LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack of evaluation metrics, and security vulnerabilities, and propose potential solutions to mitigate these concerns. Index Terms: AI Agent, LLMs † † publicationid: pubid: 979-8-3315-2508-8/25/$31.00 ©2025 IEEE I Introduction An agent is an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals. When multiple agents engage in coordination or competition within a shared environment, they form an agent system [ 1 ] . Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques enable the development of AI agent systems, which integrates perception, reasoning, learning, and action to behave intelligently in a dynamic environment [ 2 ] . Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly changed the AI agent system, driving advances in automation and human-AI collaboration [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] . Compared to traditional agent systems, which mainly relied on task-specific rules [ 10 , 11 ] or reinforcement learning (RL) [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] , LLM-powered AI agent system provides significantly more adaptability in dynamic and open environments. Agents can process and generate insights from diverse data modalities, including text, images, audio, and structured tabular data. As a result, current agent system demonstrates the ability to generalize to new tasks, produce contextually rich responses, and enable more natural human-AI interaction. In the LLM era, people often confuse AI agent systems with AI models. To clarify the distinction between the two fundamental concepts in AI, it is crucial to establish precise definitions. An agent represents a comprehensive architecture that includes environmental perception, autonomous decision-making, and goal-directed action execution [ 16 ] . Specifically, an AI agent is characterized as a self-contained computational entity that: (1) continuously perceives and interprets its environment through various input modalities, (2) processes these perceptions through cognitive functions to make context-aware decisions, and (3) executes appropriate actions to achieve predefined objectives. In contrast, an AI model constitutes a specialized computational component that performs specific patterns recognition or data transformation tasks, serving as a functional building block within larger systems. The fundamental distinctions lie in the agent’s autonomous capability to initiate and execute actions within its environment. In the LLM paradigm, AI agent systems (Fig. 1 ) emerge through the systematic integration of multiple AI models with decision-making frameworks, interactive interfaces and automated control mechanisms, thereby creating sophisticated, goal-oriented AI entities. Figure 1: LLM-Powered AI Agent System. To better understand the design space of AI agent systems, it is useful to explore their major categories. Agent systems can be categorized according to their mode of interaction with the environment, which determines their operational domain and capabilities. Broadly, we define three major types of agent systems: Software-Based Agents, Physical Agents, Adaptive and Hybrid Agents. Software-Based Agents (Sandbox Environment) operate entirely in digital environments and interact with users, applications, or online data sources. They do not have a physical presence, but can influence the world through digital means such as APIs, databases, Internet access, and simulated environments. Here are some of its industry use cases: LLM-powered Chatbots and virtual assistants - such as ChatGPT [ 17 ] , Claude [ 18 ] , Gemini [ 19 ] , DeepSeek [ 20 ] - as well as automated financial trading agents [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] . In contrast to software-based agents that operate solely in digital environments, physical agents are embodied systems that perceive and act in the real world. Physical agents, which operate in sensor-based environments, interact with the physical world using sensors, actuators, and robotics. They interact with the physical world using sensors (such as cameras, LiDAR, and microphones) to perceive their environment, and actuators (including motors, wheels, and robotic arms) to perform actions. An application of physical agents is in smart manufacturing [ 26 ] . By combining the capabilities of software-based and physical agents, hybrid agents emerge as a powerful class of systems that enable seamless integration with the real world. Adaptive and Hybrid Agents (Real-World Integration) operate in a feedback-driven environment, continuously learning from both digital and physical interactions by processing multi-modal data such as text, images, voice, and sensor inputs, and adapting their decision-making over time. Here are some of its industry use cases: AI-driven traffic management optimizing real-time road congestion [ 27 ] , Healthcare AI assistants: agents that monitor patient data, recommend treatments and interact with doctors [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ] , AI-powered predictive maintenance systems combining software analytics with sensor data [ 32 , 33 ] , AI-powered supply chain management that optimize logistics by integrating real-world shipment tracking with digital AI forecasting [ 34 ] . Most existing work or surveys on agent systems fall into two major directions: one focusing on theoretical foundations such as agent modeling and multi-agent coordination, and the other on practical frameworks such as reinforcement learning and system implementation [ 3 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] . However, the applications of LLM-powerd AI agent systems in real-world industry settings remain relatively underexplored, despite growing interest and potential impact. This paper aims to provide some insights from an industry-focused perspective on the development and categorization of LLM-powered agent systems. II Agent Systems Overview II-A Agent Systems Before LLM era Before the emergence of LLM-powered agents, traditional agents were typically based on rule-based logic, search, planning, or RL, and were often designed for narrow and task-specific domains. These systems were effective in structured environments; however, when dealing with unstructured data such as natural language or images, or when transferred... [truncated]

In the era of (multi-modal) large language models, most operational processes can be reformulated and reproduced using LLM agents. The LLM agents can perceive, control, and get feedback from the environment so as to accomplish the given tasks in an autonomous manner. Besides the environment-interaction property, the LLM agents can call various external tools to ease the task completion process. The tools can be regarded as a predefined operational process with private or real-time knowledge that does not exist in the parameters of LLMs. As a natural trend of development, the tools for calling are becoming autonomous agents, thus the full intelligent system turns out to be a LLM-based Multi-Agent System (LaMAS). Compared to the previous single-LLM-agent system, LaMAS has the advantages of i) dynamic task decomposition and organic specialization, ii) higher flexibility for system changing, iii) proprietary data preserving for each participating entity, and iv) feasibility of monetization for each entity. This paper discusses the technical and business landscapes of LaMAS. To support the ecosystem of LaMAS, we provide a preliminary version of such LaMAS protocol considering technical requirements, data privacy, and business incentives. As such, LaMAS would be a practical solution to achieve artificial collective intelligence in the near future. LLM-based Multi-Agent System, large language model, data privacy, monetization 1. Background and Trend The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI et al . , 2024 ) marks a key advancement in artificial intelligence. These models have transformed from simple text processors to sophisticated systems capable of reasoning, understanding multimodal inputs, and making autonomous decisions (Wang et al . , 2024 ) . Such developments have enabled the emergence of AI agents powered by LLMs 1 1 1 For presentation brevity, in this paper, the multi-modal LLM concept (Caffagni et al . , 2024 ) is merged into the LLM concept. , which can adapt to diverse tasks, comprehend context, and interact with their environments autonomously (Zhang et al . , 2024c ; Zhou et al . , 2024b ) . A critical transition in LLM capabilities is their evolution from passive tools that merely respond to commands to active agents capable of independent decision-making and action-taking (Schick et al . , 2023 ; Lin et al . , 2024 ) . Initially, LLMs were primarily used for single-purpose tasks, such as text generation or analysis. However, recent advances have equipped them to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and perform complex operations such as web browsing, app navigation, and system control (Zhang et al . , 2024b ) . Beyond these capabilities, modern LLMs have transformed into autonomous agents that dynamically select and use tools based on contextual requirements. This evolution highlights their dual nature: they not only utilize tools but can also function as tools within modular systems, enabling the creation of multi-agent architectures where agents collaborate to solve complex problems. The rise of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (LaMAS) marks a significant leap in AI applications (Chen et al . , 2024 ; Liu et al . , 2024 ) . Although such systems may require greater computational resources compared to single-agent approaches, they offer crucial advantages that justify this trade-off: inherent fault tolerance through agent redundancy, natural task decomposition without explicit workflow design, and organic specialization in complex problem-solving. When one agent fails in a multi-agent system, others can seamlessly continue operations, providing robust reliability that centralized systems cannot match. Moreover, while single-agent systems demand careful orchestration of execution workflows for each task type, multi-agent systems naturally emerge with collaborative specialization patterns, allowing each agent to focus on its core competencies within the larger system architecture. Recognizing these benefits, researchers have developed LaMAS frameworks to enable complex task collaboration (Guo et al . , 2024 ; Chen et al . , 2024 ; Liu et al . , 2024 ; Fourney et al . , 2024 ; Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024 ; Chen et al . , 2023 ; Qian et al . , 2023 ; Hong et al . , 2024 ; Wu et al . , 2023 ; Xie et al . , 2023 ; Li et al . , 2023 ; Gao et al . , 2024 ; Zhuge et al . , [n.d.] ; Trirat et al . , 2024 ; Fu et al . , 2024 ; Li et al . , 2024 ; Chan et al . , 2023 ) . Beyond traditional paradigms like SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, LaMAS introduces a novel approach by seamlessly integrating intelligent agents into cloud ecosystems. This framework supports the deployment of specialized agents capable of collaboration while maintaining data privacy and security. Furthermore, it establishes a marketplace for agent monetization, allowing users to customize and combine agent services according to their needs. The system architecture emphasizes modular design, standardized communication protocols, and robust security measures, fostering sustainable innovation. Incentivization via Monetization Mechanisms. Just like the Internet applications are highly incentivized to connect to the Internet, the agents in a LaMAS are also highly incentivized based on monetization mechanism design. First, the experience data generated from interacting within a LaMAS is crucial for training well-functional agents. In LaMAS, the agents receive the task instructions from upstream agents, perform inner-agent reasoning and tool usage, send task instructions to downstream agents and acquire their returned information, and obtain the final task accomplishment results. Such experience data is more valuable and of a larger volume than a single agent just connecting to the users. Second, similar to Internet monetization via online advertising, there will be a monetization mechanism over the LaMAS. Specifically, for each accomplished task that is assigned with a business value, e.g., the user books a hotel or purchases an item, there will be a promotion fee from the merchant provided to the engaged team of agents in the LaMAS and the credit allocation mechanism can be built by the participation or the essential contribution to the task accomplishment. As such, the entity behind each agent has the essential motivation to build a highly intelligent agent connecting to the LaMAS. Entity’s Responsibility based on Agent Intelligence. For the Cable or 4/5G Internet, each entity behind an Internet service, e.g., the company, institute, or team, is responsible for maintaining a stable function running and connection to the Internet. If its server crashes or the connection is disabled, the other services depending on its service will be highly influenced, thus the entity should take charge of the influence it makes. Analogously, in the LaMAS ecosystem, the entity behind each agent has the responsibility to make the ecosystem run smoothly and intelligently. First, ... [truncated]

Nowadays, businesses face a pivotal question: “ What’s the best way to harness large language models (LLMs) for their specific needs?” Three primary approaches dominate the landscape: LLM fine‑tuning, retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), and AI agents. Each has unique strengths, trade‑offs, and implications for cost, scalability, and control. The differences, use cases, and a practical LLM comparison are essential for decision-makers seeking clarity. Key considerations include LLM leaderboard rankings, LLM benchmark performance, and best practices for LLM training, all of which guide informed choices. In this article, you’ll learn: Why LLM fine‑tuning, RAG, and AI agents matter for business AI. How fine‑tuning embeds expertise, ensures consistency, and supports compliance. How RAG delivers fresh, explainable insights without retraining. How agents automate multi-step workflows across systems. Cost, scalability, and hybrid strategies for real-world adoption . Practical steps for piloting, benchmarking, and scaling anything LLM. How Mitrix helps implement tailored LLM solutions with AI agents, fine-tuning, and RAG. Why the comparison matters Naturally, not all AI problems need the same solution. Some demand custom expertise embedded in the model (fine‑tuning). Others rely on real‑time access to fresh or proprietary data (RAG). And increasingly, enterprises deploy multi‑step AI agents that combine reasoning, planning, and tool use. Without a clear framework, teams risk over-engineering or under-delivering. That’s where a practical comparison helps. It sharpens decision-making by matching solutions to real business needs. This practice also prevents wasted investment in approaches that don’t scale or align with long-term goals. RAG/CAG/Fine-tuning comparison Key takeaway Fine-tuning, RAG, and agents each solve different categories of problems, and no single method is a universal answer. Fine-tuning shines when domain expertise must be baked into the model itself. RAG ensures real-time accuracy by grounding outputs in fresh or proprietary data. Agents excel when tasks demand multi-step reasoning and tool orchestration. The real value comes from knowing when to use each (or how to combine them) so that your AI strategy is efficient, scalable, and aligned with business objectives. LLM fine‑tuning: embedding expertise into the model Fine‑tuning refers to adjusting a pre‑trained model on a narrower dataset so that it better aligns with a company’s domain, style, or compliance needs. Advantages Custom expertise . Embeds industry‑specific knowledge (e.g., legal, medical, or financial terminology). Consistency . Produces more predictable outputs for repetitive, structured tasks. Data security . Keeps sensitive workflows internal when paired with private LLM training pipelines. Challenges Cost . Training and hosting fine‑tuned models can be expensive. Maintenance . Models can become stale if regulations or data shift. Complexity . Requires understanding of how to finetune LLM effectively. Best practices If you’re exploring how to fine‑tune LLM systems, start with: Curated datasets . Quality beats quantity: clean, representative samples matter most. Instruction tuning . Aligning outputs with human preferences. Benchmarking . Use an LLM leaderboard or LLM benchmark to measure progress against baselines. Use cases Customer service with domain‑specific compliance. Contract analysis in law firms. Clinical decision support in healthcare . Key takeaway In a nutshell, LLM fine-tuning shines when stability, compliance, and domain expertise are non-negotiable. It embeds specialized knowledge directly into the model, delivers consistent outputs, and safeguards sensitive data , though at the cost of higher training and maintenance demands. For industries with strict requirements, it’s the most reliable way to align AI with business realities. Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG): injecting fresh knowledge Unlike fine‑tuning, RAG doesn’t alter the base model. Instead, it enhances responses by retrieving documents from a knowledge base at query time. Think of it as “open‑book AI.” Advantages Dynamic knowledge . Access to real‑time or frequently updated data. Lower cost . No need for repeated LLM training. Explainability . Ability to cite sources for improved trust. Challenges Latency . Retrieval adds overhead. Quality control . Poorly indexed data equals poor results. Limited reasoning . The model still relies on external context stitching. Best practices Use vector databases for efficient semantic search. Regularly update knowledge repositories. Benchmark retrieval quality against domain‑specific LLM comparison tests. Use cases Enterprise search and knowledge management. Product support documentation. Financial research with real‑time market data. Key takeaway RAG excels when access to up-to-date information is critical. It keeps models dynamic, cost-efficient, and explainable, while avoiding repeated LLM training. However, performance depends on high-quality indexing, efficient retrieval, and careful monitoring to ensure accuracy and reliability. AI agents: multi‑step reasoners and doers While fine‑tuning and RAG improve single interactions, agents represent a different paradigm. They are systems that use LLMs as reasoning engines but also interact with tools, APIs , and other agents to complete multi‑step workflows. Advantages Autonomy . Capable of executing complex tasks with minimal supervision. Flexibility . Can combine RAG, fine‑tuning, and external tools. Scalability . Extendable through modular architectures. Challenges Reliability . Prone to “ hallucinations ” without guardrails. Governance . Harder to audit multi‑step reasoning. Engineering complexity . Requires orchestration frameworks. Best practices Define clear boundaries for agent autonomy. Monitor workflows continuously. Leverage LLM benchmarks to evaluate reasoning performance. Use cases Automated research assistants. Supply chain optimization. Customer onboarding journeys that require multiple systems. Key takeaway To cut a long story short, AI agents take LLM capabilities beyond single-turn answers by chaining reasoning with action. They offer autonomy, flexibility, and scalability, but come with reliability and governance challenges that require careful orchestration. Teams that define clear guardrails, monitor workflows, and ground performance with LLM benchmarks can unlock use cases from automated research to end-to-end customer journeys. LLM leaderboards, benchmarks, and reality checks In 2025, the surge of public LLM leaderboards has made it easier to track how different models perform across tasks. But remember: benchmarks are abstractions. They often emphasize math, reasoning, or academic QA tasks, which may not reflect your business context. When running an LLM comparison for your project: Use public LLM benchmarks as a starting point. Create internal benchmarks tied to your data. Test across scenarios like latency, compliance, and user satisfaction. Benchmarks tell you how a model performs in theory, while pilots tell you how it performs in practice. Another limitation is that leaderboard results usually come from controlled test sets and don’t capture operational realities. For example, a model may rank high on reasoning tasks but struggle when integrated into workflows with strict latency requirements. Cost... [truncated]

How do they differ in capabilities and complexity? Which is best suited for your goals? Whether you’re leading a digital transformation initiative or simply looking to make smarter decisions with AI, this side-by-side comparison of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic RAG, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) will help you confidently choose the right approach. Let’s break it down. Contents hide 1 What Are RAG, Agentic RAG, and MCP? 1.1 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 1.2 Agentic RAG 1.3 MCP (Model Context Protocol) 2 How RAG, Agentic RAG, and MCP Differ: Side-by-Side Comparison 3 Which One Should You Use: RAG, Agentic RAG, or MCP? 4 Why Bitcot is the Right Partner No Matter Which AI Framework You Choose 5 Final Thoughts 6 FAQs What Are RAG, Agentic RAG, and MCP? Before diving into comparisons, let’s define each approach in clear, business-relevant terms: what they are, what they do, and where they fit in real-world AI use cases. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by letting them “look things up.” Instead of relying only on what the model was trained on, RAG retrieves relevant documents or knowledge from an external source (like a database or vector store) before generating a response. Use it for: Chatbots that answer based on company knowledge. Customer service bots with access to FAQs and manuals. Sales reps that summarize case studies or product info on demand. Strength: High-accuracy answers using up-to-date, controlled content. Limitation: Passive; answers only what’s asked, no autonomy or reasoning. Agentic RAG Agentic RAG adds goal-driven reasoning to traditional RAG. RAG AI agents and Agentic RAG represent two stages of intelligent retrieval systems, starting with basic response generation and evolving into systems with planning and tool-use capabilities. This evolution introduces a layer of autonomy that RAG alone cannot achieve. Instead of just answering questions, the AI becomes an agent that can plan steps, retrieve multiple pieces of information over time, use tools (like web search or APIs), and reflect on progress toward a goal. Use it for: Research agents that proactively gather insights. Internal assistants that answer, verify, and summarize from multiple sources. Complex workflows where context evolves. Strength: Autonomy + search = more useful, more flexible. Limitation: Harder to control, test, or explain compared to simple RAG. RAG AI agents and Agentic RAG represent two stages of intelligent retrieval systems, starting with basic response generation and evolving into systems with planning and tool-use capabilities. This evolution introduces a layer of autonomy that RAG alone cannot achieve. MCP (Model Context Protocol) MCP is a framework for building modular, transparent, and fully autonomous AI agents. It organizes everything an agent needs, its memory, tools, instructions, and roles, into a reusable “protocol” that drives how it reasons, acts, and evolves.

      • Once we’ve clarified your goals, we design and build using the framework that fits your current business readiness:   RAG → When your priority is fast, accurate answers from internal data.  Example: A knowledge assistant trained on your HR policies or product manuals.   Agentic RAG → When you need goal-driven, step-by-step reasoning with smart retrieval.  Example: A sales research agent that pulls competitive insights and drafts summaries. [...] You need a fast, accurate chatbot that pulls from documents or a knowledge base.  Your users are asking direct questions with relatively short answers.  You want tight control over what the AI says, using trusted content.  Example: Customer service bots, policy lookup tools, product assistants.  RAG is ideal for content-rich workflows where accuracy matters more than autonomy.  #### Use Agentic RAG if… [...] Your team needs AI to reason through tasks, not just answer them.  You’re working with research-heavy, multi-step questions.  You want to simulate a helpful assistant, not just a search engine.  Example: Market research agents, onboarding helpers, email summarizers.  Agentic RAG is a step toward AI assistants; great for knowledge work that needs judgment.  #### Use MCP if…
      • Complex Query Handling: If your application needs to handle complex tasks, multi-part questions, or open-ended requests that require decision-making or multiple operations, lean towards agentic RAG. For example, an AI assistant that can research a topic and produce a report (involving gathering info from various sources) would benefit from an agentic approach. Traditional RAG would struggle with such a query unless it was manually broken down by the user or developer. Agentic RAG shines when [...] In short, use Agentic RAG when the problem demands it — i.e., complexity, multi-step reasoning, or action-taking beyond what a static retrieval provides. Otherwise, a traditional RAG will often be more efficient and easier to manage. It’s not an either/or for all cases; some systems may even combine them (for example, an agent that itself uses a traditional RAG as one of its tools).  ## Best Practices and Tooling in the Full Stack/Data Ecosystem [...] straightforward RAG, the robustness and simplicity of that approach can outweigh the theoretical benefits of an agent. In many enterprise scenarios, a hybrid approach is used: e.g., default to a standard RAG for most queries, but have an agentic process for particularly complex requests (perhaps triggered by some classification of the query).
      • The motivation behind agentic RAG development stems from use cases that require context-aware generation and real-time actions. Examples encompass advanced robotics, legal advisory services, healthcare diagnostics, and ongoing customer service engagements.    In these contexts, merely retrieving relevant information is insufficient. The agent must analyze the information, assess its importance, determine a response, and potentially execute an action in a continuous feedback loop. [...] For example, a GPS navigation system acts as a goal-oriented agent. Users set a destination, and the agent assesses the best route based on distance, traffic, and road conditions. After selecting a path, the system provides step-by-step guidance to reach the destination.    We will consider the following diagram:  Source [...] An autonomous vehicle is a practical example of a utility-based agent. It assesses various factors such as travel time, fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and safety. It also uses a utility function to balance conflicting goals for the optimal route and driving style.    Let’s consider the following diagram:  source

But what do they actually mean, and which one is right for your organization? This guide cuts through the technical jargon and gets straight to the point: What are these AI frameworks? How do they differ in capabilities and complexity? Which is best suited for your goals? Whether you’re leading a digital transformation initiative or simply looking to make smarter decisions with AI, this side-by-side comparison of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic RAG, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) will help you confidently choose the right approach. Let’s break it down.

Before diving into comparisons, let’s define each approach in clear, business-relevant terms: what they are, what they do, and where they fit in real-world AI use cases. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by letting them “look things up.” Instead of relying only on what the model was trained on, RAG retrieves relevant documents or knowledge from an external source (like a database or vector store) before generating a response. Use it for: Chatbots that answer based on company knowledge. Customer service bots with access to FAQs and manuals. Sales reps that summarize case studies or product info on demand. Strength: High-accuracy answers using up-to-date, controlled content. Limitation: Passive; answers only what’s asked, no autonomy or reasoning. Agentic RAG Agentic RAG adds goal-driven reasoning to traditional RAG. RAG AI agents and Agentic RAG represent two stages of intelligent retrieval systems, starting with basic response generation and evolving into systems with planning and tool-use capabilities. This evolution introduces a layer of autonomy that RAG alone cannot achieve. Instead of just answering questions, the AI becomes an agent that can plan steps, retrieve multiple pieces of information over time, use tools (like web search or APIs), and reflect on progress toward a goal. Use it for: Research agents that proactively gather insights. Internal assistants that answer, verify, and summarize from multiple sources. Complex workflows where context evolves. Strength: Autonomy + search = more useful, more flexible. Limitation: Harder to control, test, or explain compared to simple RAG. RAG AI agents and Agentic RAG represent two stages of intelligent retrieval systems, starting with basic response generation and evolving into systems with planning and tool-use capabilities. This evolution introduces a layer of autonomy that RAG alone cannot achieve. MCP (Model Context Protocol) MCP is a framework for building modular, transparent, and fully autonomous AI agents. It organizes everything an agent needs, its memory, tools, instructions, and roles, into a reusable “protocol” that drives how it reasons, acts, and evolves. Use it for: Building AI agents with MCP that interact seamlessly with tools, data, and people. Agents that learn from feedback and adapt over time. Enterprise AI that’s structured, auditable, and explainable. Strength: Full agent control, modularity, and long-term memory. Limitation: Requires thoughtful design; best used when agents must act autonomously with accountability. How RAG, Agentic RAG, and MCP Differ: Side-by-Side Comparison The comparison of MCP vs RAG in AI highlights the progression from simple retrieval-based responses (RAG) to more dynamic, goal-oriented systems (Agentic RAG), and ultimately to MCP, offering long-term memory, autonomy, and multi-system integration.

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation has recently attracted attention due to its capacity to ground large language models to external, up-to-date knowledge. In the meantime, AI agents —intelligent software that can perceive and respond to their environment— are essential for tasks involving sequential decision-making, flexibility, and planning. As tasks become more complex, relying solely on one approach (RAG or AI agents) may not be enough. This has resulted in Agentic RAG , which merges RAG’s knowledge capabilities with AI agents’ decision-making skills. This article thoroughly explores RAG, AI agents, and Agentic RAG, emphasizing their theoretical background, foundational principles, and use cases. Prerequisites Before exploring the complexities of AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, it’s important to understand the following foundational elements: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence : Understanding key AI principles like machine learning and natural language processing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation : Insight into how RAG combines retrieval methods with generative models. Autonomous Systems : A fundamental understanding of the importance of autonomy in modern AI applications. Definition and Conceptual Overview of RAG Retrieval-augmented generation merges large language models with retrieval systems, grounding responses in external data instead of relying solely on the training parameters. Traditional LLMs, despite their power, often produce plausible but factually incorrect responses known as hallucinations. Integrating an external retrieval step allows RAG to fetch and add factual or contextual information. An application of the RAG system can be described in the diagram below: Image Source For example, if a user asks a large language model like ChatGPT about a trending news story, the model’s limitations become apparent. It relies on outdated, static information and cannot access real-time updates. RAG addresses this by drawing the latest relevant data from external sources. So, when a user inquires about a news story, RAG fetches the most recent articles or reports related to that question, which are combined with the original query to form a more informative prompt. This augmented prompt enables the language model to generate well-knowledgeable and accurate responses by integrating retrieved knowledge into its output. Consequently, RAG improves the model’s ability to deliver precise and timely information, especially in fields requiring real-time updates, like news, scientific advancements, or financial markets. Key Paradigms of RAG The RAG research model is undergoing important evolution, which can be categorized into three distinct phases: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as illustrated in the image below: Image Source Naive RAG: Initial Methods and Limitations The Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation method represented the initial phase of retrieval-augmented techniques. It uses a straightforward pipeline consisting of: Indexing: Documents are divided into smaller... [truncated]

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      RAG는 내부 데이터로부터 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적이며, Agent 기반 접근법은 목표 기반 추론과 의사 결정을 필요로 하는 복잡한 시나리오에 적합합니다. 상황에 따라 적절한 접근 방식을 선택하거나 결합하는 것이 중요합니다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   RAG는 고정된 프로세스와 예측 가능한 데이터에 기반한 단순한 질의 응답 작업에 적합하며, 내부의 정적 데이터로부터 빠른 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다 [3], [5].
      *   Agent 기반 RAG (Agentic RAG)는 목표 기반 추론, 의사 결정, 도구 선택이 필요한 복잡한 시나리오에서 뛰어난 성능을 보이며, RAG와 AI 에이전트의 기능을 통합합니다 [2], [5].
      *   AI 에이전트는 프로젝트 관리자처럼 의사 결정을 내리고 행동을 수행하는 반면, RAG는 LLM(Large Language Model)을 외부 지식으로 강화합니다 [4].
      *   안정성을 위해서는 파인튜닝, 적응성을 위해서는 RAG, 오케스트레이션을 위해서는 에이전트가 유용하며, 이러한 접근 방식들을 결합하는 것이 효과적일 수 있습니다 [3].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** RAG는 검색된 정보를 기반으로 생성 모델이 답변을 생성하는 방식입니다. 특히 내부 데이터로부터 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적이며 정적인 콘텐츠를 다룰 때 유용합니다 [3], [5]. 워크플로우가 고정되어 있어 예측 가능한 데이터와 정해진 프로세스를 갖는 작업에 적합합니다 [5]. 예를 들어, 회사 내부 문서 검색 시스템을 구축하여 사용자 질문에 대한 답변을 제공하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다.
      
      **Agent 기반 RAG (Agentic RAG):** Agent 기반 RAG는 목표 기반 추론이 필요한 경우에 유리하며, 복잡하고 다단계 프로세스에 대한 더 많은 유연성과 적응성을 제공합니다 [2], [5]. 이 방식은 검색 프로세스를 AI 에이전트 기능과 통합하여 검색된 정보를 어떻게 활용할지 적극적으로 결정하여 목표를 달성합니다 [2]. 복잡한 작업, 다단계 질문 또는 연구 보고서 작성과 같이 의사 결정이나 여러 작업이 필요한 개방형 요청에 적합합니다 [2]. Agent는 도구를 선택하고, 검색 결과를 평가하고, 다음 단계를 결정하는 등 복잡한 의사결정 과정을 수행할 수 있습니다.
      
      **AI 에이전트 vs. RAG:** RAG는 LLM을 외부 지식으로 강화하는 반면, AI 에이전트는 의사 결정을 내리고 조치를 취하는 프로젝트 관리자와 같은 역할을 수행합니다 [4]. RAG는 단순히 정보를 검색하고 LLM에게 제공하지만, AI 에이전트는 목표를 달성하기 위해 여러 단계를 계획하고 실행할 수 있습니다.
      
      **적절한 접근 방식 선택:** 안정성이 중요한 경우에는 파인튜닝, 적응성이 중요한 경우에는 RAG, 복잡한 작업 흐름을 관리해야 하는 경우에는 에이전트 기반 접근법을 선택하는 것이 좋습니다 [3]. 이러한 접근 방식을 결합하여 사용하는 것도 가능합니다 [3]. 예를 들어, 특정 도메인에 대한 지식을 LLM에 주입하기 위해 파인튜닝을 사용하고, 사용자 질문에 따라 외부 지식을 검색하여 답변을 생성하기 위해 RAG를 사용하며, 복잡한 질문에 대한 답변을 생성하기 위해 에이전트 기반 접근법을 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 질의 응답 작업에는 전통적인 RAG가 적합하며, 의사 결정과 도구 선택이 필요한 복잡한 시나리오에는 Agent 기반 RAG가 더 적합합니다 [5].

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      RAG와 Agent 기반 접근법은 각각 강점과 약점을 가지고 있으며, 특정 사용 사례에 따라 적합성이 달라집니다. RAG는 단순하고 빠른 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적인 반면, Agent 기반 접근법은 복잡한 문제를 해결하고 목표를 달성하는 데 유용합니다. 따라서 문제의 복잡성, 필요한 유연성 및 적응성, 목표 달성을 위한 의사 결정 필요성 등을 고려하여 적절한 접근 방식을 선택하는 것이 중요합니다. 또한, 여러 접근 방식을 결합하여 사용하는 것이 가장 효과적인 솔루션을 제공할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 파인튜닝으로 모델의 기본적인 지식을 강화하고, RAG로 최신 정보를 검색하여 답변의 정확도를 높이며, 에이전트 기반 접근법으로 복잡한 추론과 의사 결정을 처리할 수 있습니다.

RAG는 내부 데이터로부터 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적이며, Agent 기반 접근법은 목표 기반 추론과 의사 결정을 필요로 하는 복잡한 시나리오에 적합합니다. 상황에 따라 적절한 접근 방식을 선택하거나 결합하는 것이 중요합니다.

## 주요 발견 사항

*   RAG는 고정된 프로세스와 예측 가능한 데이터에 기반한 단순한 질의 응답 작업에 적합하며, 내부의 정적 데이터로부터 빠른 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다 [3], [5].
*   Agent 기반 RAG (Agentic RAG)는 목표 기반 추론, 의사 결정, 도구 선택이 필요한 복잡한 시나리오에서 뛰어난 성능을 보이며, RAG와 AI 에이전트의 기능을 통합합니다 [2], [5].
*   AI 에이전트는 프로젝트 관리자처럼 의사 결정을 내리고 행동을 수행하는 반면, RAG는 LLM(Large Language Model)을 외부 지식으로 강화합니다 [4].
*   안정성을 위해서는 파인튜닝, 적응성을 위해서는 RAG, 오케스트레이션을 위해서는 에이전트가 유용하며, 이러한 접근 방식들을 결합하는 것이 효과적일 수 있습니다 [3].

## 상세 분석

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** RAG는 검색된 정보를 기반으로 생성 모델이 답변을 생성하는 방식입니다. 특히 내부 데이터로부터 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적이며 정적인 콘텐츠를 다룰 때 유용합니다 [3], [5]. 워크플로우가 고정되어 있어 예측 가능한 데이터와 정해진 프로세스를 갖는 작업에 적합합니다 [5]. 예를 들어, 회사 내부 문서 검색 시스템을 구축하여 사용자 질문에 대한 답변을 제공하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다.

**Agent 기반 RAG (Agentic RAG):** Agent 기반 RAG는 목표 기반 추론이 필요한 경우에 유리하며, 복잡하고 다단계 프로세스에 대한 더 많은 유연성과 적응성을 제공합니다 [2], [5]. 이 방식은 검색 프로세스를 AI 에이전트 기능과 통합하여 검색된 정보를 어떻게 활용할지 적극적으로 결정하여 목표를 달성합니다 [2]. 복잡한 작업, 다단계 질문 또는 연구 보고서 작성과 같이 의사 결정이나 여러 작업이 필요한 개방형 요청에 적합합니다 [2]. Agent는 도구를 선택하고, 검색 결과를 평가하고, 다음 단계를 결정하는 등 복잡한 의사결정 과정을 수행할 수 있습니다.

**AI 에이전트 vs. RAG:** RAG는 LLM을 외부 지식으로 강화하는 반면, AI 에이전트는 의사 결정을 내리고 조치를 취하는 프로젝트 관리자와 같은 역할을 수행합니다 [4]. RAG는 단순히 정보를 검색하고 LLM에게 제공하지만, AI 에이전트는 목표를 달성하기 위해 여러 단계를 계획하고 실행할 수 있습니다.

**적절한 접근 방식 선택:** 안정성이 중요한 경우에는 파인튜닝, 적응성이 중요한 경우에는 RAG, 복잡한 작업 흐름을 관리해야 하는 경우에는 에이전트 기반 접근법을 선택하는 것이 좋습니다 [3]. 이러한 접근 방식을 결합하여 사용하는 것도 가능합니다 [3]. 예를 들어, 특정 도메인에 대한 지식을 LLM에 주입하기 위해 파인튜닝을 사용하고, 사용자 질문에 따라 외부 지식을 검색하여 답변을 생성하기 위해 RAG를 사용하며, 복잡한 질문에 대한 답변을 생성하기 위해 에이전트 기반 접근법을 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 질의 응답 작업에는 전통적인 RAG가 적합하며, 의사 결정과 도구 선택이 필요한 복잡한 시나리오에는 Agent 기반 RAG가 더 적합합니다 [5].

## 결론 및 평가

RAG와 Agent 기반 접근법은 각각 강점과 약점을 가지고 있으며, 특정 사용 사례에 따라 적합성이 달라집니다. RAG는 단순하고 빠른 답변을 제공하는 데 효과적인 반면, Agent 기반 접근법은 복잡한 문제를 해결하고 목표를 달성하는 데 유용합니다. 따라서 문제의 복잡성, 필요한 유연성 및 적응성, 목표 달성을 위한 의사 결정 필요성 등을 고려하여 적절한 접근 방식을 선택하는 것이 중요합니다. 또한, 여러 접근 방식을 결합하여 사용하는 것이 가장 효과적인 솔루션을 제공할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 파인튜닝으로 모델의 기본적인 지식을 강화하고, RAG로 최신 정보를 검색하여 답변의 정확도를 높이며, 에이전트 기반 접근법으로 복잡한 추론과 의사 결정을 처리할 수 있습니다.
