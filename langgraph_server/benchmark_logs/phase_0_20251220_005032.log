      ## 핵심 요약
      
      LangGraph와 CrewAI는 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축을 위한 인기 있는 프레임워크이지만, 아키텍처와 사용 목적에 있어 뚜렷한 차이를 보인다. CrewAI는 역할 기반 아키텍처로 팀워크를 시뮬레이션하는 데 용이하며, LangGraph는 그래프 기반 아키텍처로 복잡하고 조건부 실행이 필요한 워크플로우에 적합하다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   **아키텍처**: CrewAI는 역할 기반 아키텍처, LangGraph는 그래프 기반 아키텍처를 채택한다.
      *   **제어 수준**: LangGraph는 CrewAI보다 에이전트에 대한 더 낮은 수준의 제어를 제공한다.
      *   **통합**: LangGraph는 LangChain 생태계 내에 통합되어 다양한 기능과 관찰 기능을 활용할 수 있다.
      *   **유연성**: CrewAI는 역할 기반의 유연성이 뛰어나며, LangGraph는 그래프 기반 상태 머신 아키텍처의 유연성이 뛰어나다.
      *   **사용 용이성**: CrewA

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      2024년 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템 연구는 멀티 에이전트 시스템의 발전과 응용, 그리고 그 과정에서 발생하는 문제점과 해결 방안에 집중하고 있다. 특히 소프트웨어 엔지니어링, 데이터 과학 등 다양한 분야에서 LLM 에이전트의 활용이 증가하고 있으며, 에이전트의 효율성과 안정성을 높이기 위한 연구가 활발히 진행 중이다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   **멀티 에이전트 시스템의 중요성 증가**: 단일 LLM 에이전트에서 벗어나 협업을 통해 복잡한 문제를 해결하는 멀티 에이전트 시스템이 주목받고 있다. (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI 등의 프레임워크 활용 증가)
      *   **특정 분야(소프트웨어 엔지니어링, 데이터 과학)에서의 활용**: 소프트웨어 개발 자동화, 데이터 탐색 및 분석 등 특정 분야에서 LLM 에이전트의 적용 사례가 늘고 있다.
      *   **에이전트의 효율성 및 품질 향상**: LLM 호출 비용 절감, 에이전트의 다단계 추론 능력 향상,

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation, 검색 증강 생성)는 정보 검색과 대규모 언어 모델을 결합하여 답변을 생성하는 방식이며, 에이전트 기반 접근법은 자율적인 에이전트가 추론, 계획, 행동을 통해 복잡한 작업을 수행하는 방식입니다. RAG는 비교적 정적인 지식 기반에 적합하며, 에이전트 기반 접근법은 동적이고 복잡한 환경에서 더욱 강력한 솔루션을 제공합니다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   **RAG (검색 증강 생성):** 관련 데이터를 검색하고 벡터 데이터베이스에 저장한 다음, 검색된 정보를 프롬프트에 추가하여 LLM이 답변을 생성하도록 합니다. 빠르고 정확한 정보 검색에 유리합니다.
