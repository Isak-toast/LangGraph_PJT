Developers now want tools that can orchestrate multiple agents, manage shared state, and support complex workflows with branching, looping, and retries. Two notable frameworks leading this space are CrewAI and LangGraph. While CrewAI focuses on collaborative agent teams—where each agent has a specific role, goal, and communication strategy—LangGraph provides a graph-based workflow engine designed for building structured, resilient LLM applications. Both aim to simplify multi-agent development but approach the problem from different angles: CrewAI emphasizes team coordination, whereas LangGraph emphasizes stateful, production-ready execution. In this comparison, we’ll break down their core philosophies, features, and use cases to help you decide which framework better fits your AI development needs. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is an open-source, Python-based framework designed for orchestrating autonomous, collaborative AI agents, much like a digital team handling complex tasks. Each agent operates with a defined role, such as researcher, writer, or analyst, and works together within a structured crew to solve problems efficiently. CrewAI combines modularity with performance, offering both high-level simplicity and precise control over how agents interact. Through components like Crews and Flows, it supports dynamic collaboration while giving developers the ability to manage control flows, tasks, and environments with flexibility. Agents in CrewAI are set up with defined roles, goals, tools, and even personality through backstories. This is similar to how a human team organizes itself to divide work and minimize errors. The framework allows agents to work sequentially or in parallel, with coordination

Instead of coding every rule or path, you can now create agents that handle tasks and coordinate with each other. LangGraph and CrewAI tackle this in different ways. Let’s look at how each framework works, what they do well, and where they make the most sense in production. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source orchestration framework for building stateful, long-running agents. It’s part of the LangChain ecosystem but can also run independently. Workflows in LangGraph are modeled as state graphs , where nodes represent actions and edges define control flow. Each node takes in the current state, performs an operation, like calling a language model, querying a database, or executing custom logic, and returns an updated state. This structure keeps execution paths clear and easy to debug. LangGraph is built for teams that need reliable, production-grade automation with clear control and visibility. It’s a good fit for workflows that require consistency and human oversight, like customer operations or document processing. Core Capabilities Durable execution : Workflows can recover automatically from crashes or restarts, resuming from the last checkpoint. This is useful for long-running processes like approvals or batch jobs. Human-in-the-loop : You can pause execution at any point, wait for human input, and resume later with that input included. State is stored persistently, so workflows can pause indefinitely. Memory management : Supports both short-term and long-term memory. Agents retain conversation history and past context across sessions for consistent decision-making. LangSmith integration : Provides debugging tools and observability. You can trace execution paths, inspect state transitions, and monitor runtime metrics. Flexible agent creation: Use create_react_agent for quick setup or build custom graphs manually for full control over logic and flow. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is a Python framework built independently of LangChain. It’s open source under the MIT license and focuses on multi-agent coordination. The framework offers two main approaches: Crews for autonomous agent collaboration and Flows for event-driven workflow control. Crews organize agents by roles such as researcher, writer, or analyst and assign them tasks. Flows manage complex execution paths with conditional branching and state management. CrewAI focuses on speed and simplicity. It needs less setup than graph-based frameworks, so you can build multi-agent systems with only a small amount of code. Core Capabilities CrewAI handles multi-agent workflows through key features: Agent structure: Work is organized around agents with roles, goals, and backstories that define how they behave. Tasks assign objectives and specify which agent handles them. Work can run sequentially or in hierarchical mode, where a manager agent delegates tasks. Autonomous operation: Agents handle tasks independently. They choose tools, request help from other agents, and escalate tasks they can’t complete. This coordination comes from configuration rather than hardcoded routing. Flows for control: Event-driven workflows use decorators like @start , @ listen , and @router . Conditions can be combined with or _

CrewAI emphasizes team coordination, while LangGraph emphasizes stateful execution [1], [2].
      
      **Setup and Abstraction:**
      CrewAI offers a faster initial setup, enabling users to quickly build multi-agent systems [1], [2]. It provides better abstractions for agent collaboration, allowing agents to communicate naturally, delegate tasks, and operate in parallel [1], [2]. CrewAI's architecture is modular, separating agent creation, task definition, and process orchestration, which allows for customization while maintaining abstraction [1], [2]. LangGraph, however, requires a deeper understanding of graph structures and state management, which can take longer to master [1], [2]. LangGraph requires explicit graph design for coordination [1], [2].
      
      **Control and Scalability:**
      LangGraph is better suited for complex workflows that demand precise control and advanced debugging capabilities [1], [2]. It provides low-level control over agent workflows, incorporating built-in persistence, streaming support, and the ability to create complex branching logic [1], [2]. LangGraph implements a graph-based architecture focused on managing application state through a central persistence layer [2]. CrewAI is geared more towards longer-running operations and demonstrates scalability in production environments; it also includes Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) capabilities [1], [2].
      
      **Agent Coordination and Workflow Management:**
      CrewAI offers simple orchestration of multi-agent teams with role/task assignment and coordination/delegation mechanisms [1], [2]. CrewAI features a clear object structure (Agent, Crew, Task, etc.) and seamless state management with out-of-the-box agent coordination [1], [2]. LangGraph offers fine-grained control over multi-agent workflows with a graph-based architecture and built-in support for complex state management, retries, and event handling [1], [2]. LangGraph has a well-established memory concept, making memory management more straightforward [2].

      ## 상세 분석
      
      **개요:** CrewAI와 LangGraph는 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축을 위한 프레임워크라는 공통점을 가지지만, 설계 철학과 사용 사례에서 뚜렷한 차이를 보인다.

Abstract : Large language model-based multi-agent systems have shown great abilities across various tasks due to the collaboration of expert agents, each focusing on a specific domain. However, the impact of clumsy or even malicious agents—those who frequently make errors in their tasks—on the overall performance of the system remains underexplored. This paper investigates: (1) What is the resilience of various system structures (e.g., A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C, A$\leftrightarrow$B$\leftrightarrow$C) under faulty agents, on different downstream tasks? (2) How can we increase system resilience to defend against these agents? To simulate faulty agents, we propose two approaches—AutoTransform and AutoInject—which introduce mistakes into the agents&#x27; responses. Experiments on four downstream tasks using six systems show that the &quot;hierarchical&quot; structure, i.e., A$\rightarrow$(B$\leftrightarrow$C), exhibits superior resilience with the lowest performance drop of 5.5%, compared to 10.5% and 23.7% of other two structures. To further improve resilience, we introduce (1) Challenger, that introduces a mechanism for each agent to challenge others&#x27; outputs, and (2) Inspector, an additional agent to review and correct messages, recovering up to 96.4% errors made by faulty agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/MAS-Resilience. Lay Summary : Teams of AI “agents” built on large language models can solve coding, maths and translation tasks, but one careless—or malicious—agent can poison the discussion and drag down the whole team. We create two automated stress-tests: AutoTransform, which rewrites an agent’s role so it secretly adds mistakes, and AutoInject, which slips errors directly into its messages. Using them, we explore how different multi-agent structures (linear chains, flat peer groups and human-like hierarchies) and different tasks suffer from these faulty agents. A hierarchical structure—one “boss” overseeing peer agents—proved most robust, losing only ≈ 5% accuracy, while a simple chain collapsed by ≈ 24%. Adding two simple safeguards—a “Challenger” ability that lets agents question each other and an independent “Inspector” reviewer—recovered up to 96% of the lost performance. Our open-source toolkit lets researchers and companies quickly gauge and harden the resilience of their AI agents before deploying in the wild.

      • In 2024, developers leaned into complexity with multi-step agents, sharpened efficiency by doing more with fewer LLM calls, and added quality checks to their apps using methods of feedback and evaluation. As more LLM apps are created, we’re excited to see how folks dig into smarter workflows, better performance, and stronger reliability. [...] As we did last year, we want to share some product usage patterns that showcase how the AI ecosystem and practice of building LLM apps are evolving. As folks have traced, evaluated, and iterated their way around LangSmith, we’ve seen a few notable changes. These include the dramatic rise of open-source model adoption and a shift from predominantly retrieval workflows to AI agent applications with multi-step, agentic workflows. [...] As companies are getting more serious about incorporating AI agents across various industries, adoption of our controllable agent framework, LangGraph, is also on the rise. Since its release in March 2024, LangGraph has steadily gained traction — with 43% of LangSmith organizations are now sending LangGraph traces. These traces represent complex, orchestrated tasks that go beyond basic LLM interactions.
      • This time last year, I wrote that AI engineering in 2023 was defined by a proliferation of LLMs and an expansion of AI dev tooling. In 2024, those trends continued — but also the market for both LLMs and AI development tools matured considerably. This year, AI got integrated into the core tools of developers (IDEs), while new techniques for creating “AI agents” arose in secondary tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. The types of LLMs available also became more varied, with smaller models and [...] Meanwhile, in a separate presentation at the World’s Fair, LlamaIndex creator Jerry Liu pitched agents as the natural successor to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the most common method of integrating a pretrained LLM with an external data source. LlamaIndex calls its AI agents “knowledge assistants,” perhaps to make them more enterprise-friendly. [...] In 2024, we’ve observed the maturing of AI software (especially AI coding tools for developers), a push toward more automation (AI agents), the emergence of small models and locally hosted LLMs, and some clarification on what is or isn’t open source (although that debate will continue into the new year).  This year also proved that being an AI engineer is a viable career option — especially if you want to dive even deeper into AI than tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor allow.

However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment &amp; profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

By LangChain 6 min read Dec 19, 2024 Another year of building with LLMs is coming to an end —&nbsp;and 2024 didn’t disappoint. With nearly 30k users signing up for LangSmith every month, we’re lucky to have front row seats to what’s happening in the industry.&nbsp; As we did last year , we want to share some product usage patterns that showcase how the AI&nbsp;ecosystem and practice of building LLM apps are evolving. As folks have traced, evaluated, and iterated their way around LangSmith, we’ve seen a few notable changes. These include the dramatic rise of open-source model adoption and a shift from predominantly retrieval workflows to AI agent applications with multi-step, agentic workflows.&nbsp; Dive into the stats below to learn exactly what developers are building, testing, and prioritizing. Infrastructure usage With Large Language Models (LLMs) eating the world, everyone’s asking the mirror-mirror-on-the-wall question: “Which model is the most utilized of them all?” Let’s unpack what we’ve seen. Top LLM providers Like last year’s results , OpenAI reigns as the most used LLM provider among LangSmith users —&nbsp;used more than 6x as much as Ollama, the next-most popular provider (counted by LangSmith organization usage). Interestingly, Ollama and Groq (which both allow users to run open source models, with the former focusing on local execution and the latter on cloud deployment) have accelerated in momentum this year, breaking into the top 5. This shows a growing interest in more flexible deployment options and customizable AI infrastructure. When it comes to providers that offer open-source models, the top providers have stayed relatively consistent compared to last year - Ollama, Mistral, and Hugging Face have made it easy for developers to run open source models on their platforms. These OSS providers’ collective usage represents 20% of the top 20 LLM providers (by the number of organizations using them).&nbsp; Top Retrievers / Vector Stores Performing retrieval is still critical for many GenAI workflows. The top 3 vector stores have remained the same as last year, with Chroma and FAISS as the most popular choices. This year, Milvus, MongoDB, and Elastic’s vector databases have also entered the top 10.&nbsp; Building with LangChain products As developers have gained more experience utilizing generative AI, they are also building more dynamic applications. From the growing sophistication of workflows, to the rise of AI agents — we’re seeing a few trends that point to an evolving ecosystem of innovation. Observability isn’t limited to LangChain applications While langchain (our open source framework) is central to many folks’ LLM app development journeys, 15.7% of LangSmith traces this year come from non- langchain frameworks. This reflects a broader trend where observability is needed regardless of what framework you’re using to build the LLM app — and that interoperability is supported by LangSmith. Python remains dominant, while JavaScript usage grows Debugging, testing, and monitoring certainly has a special place in our Python developers’ hearts, with 84.7% usage coming from the Python SDK. But there is a notable and growing interest in JavaScript as developers pursue web-first applications —&nbsp;the JavaScript SDK accounts for 15.3% of LangSmith usage this year, increasing 3x compared to the previous year.&nbsp; AI agents are gaining traction As companies are getting more serious about incorporating AI agents across various industries , adoption of our controllable agent framework, LangGraph, is also on the rise. Since its release in March 2024, LangGraph has steadily gained traction —&nbsp;with 43% of LangSmith organizations are now

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      2024년 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템 연구는 LLM의 의사 결정 능력 활용, 다중 에이전트 시스템의 발전, 그리고 인간-에이전트 시스템의 통합에 집중하고 있으며, 복잡한 멀티 스텝 에이전트 개발, LLM 호출 효율성 증대, 품질 검사 도입이 주요 트렌드입니다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   LLM은 명령어 해석, 작업 관리, 적응성을 바탕으로 의사 결정 에이전트로 광범위하게 활용되고 있습니다 [1].
      *   연구는 작업 환경 내에서 에이전트 상호 작용, 특성 분석, 커뮤니케이션, 능력 개발에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다 [1].
      *   LLM 기반의 다중 에이전트 시스템은 시뮬레이션 환경, 에이전트 프로파일링, 커뮤니케이션, 에이전트 역량 강화를 위한 메커니즘을 중심으로 탐구되고 있습니다 [1].
      *   2024년 트렌드는 더욱 복잡한 멀티 스텝 에이전트, LLM 호출 사용의 효율성 증대, 품질 검사 통합을 포함합니다 [3].
      *   인간-에이전트 시스템은 인간의 강점과 LLM의 능력을 결합하여 시스템 성능, 신뢰성, 안전성을 향상시킵니다 [5].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      **LLM 기반 에이전트의 역할 확대:**
      
      LLM은 단순히 텍스트 생성 모델을 넘어, 지시 사항을 이해하고, 순차적인 작업을 관리하며, 피드백을 통해 스스로 적응하는 능력을 갖춘 의사 결정 에이전트로서 자리매김하고 있습니다 [1]. 많은 에이전트 구현체들이 LLM을 오케스트레이터로 활용하여 기존 API를 도구로 호출함으로써 프로세스를 효율화하고 있습니다 [1]. 이는 LLM이 특정 작업을 수행하기 위한 '두뇌' 역할을 수행하며, 외부 도구를 활용하여 실제 행동을 수행하는 방식으로 이해할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 여행 계획 에이전트는 LLM을 사용하여 사용자 요청을 분석하고, 항공편 검색 API, 호텔 예약 API 등을 호출하여 최적의 여행 계획을 수립할 수 있습니다.
      
      **다중 에이전트 시스템의 진화:**
      
      LLM 기반의 다중 에이전트 시스템 연구는 시뮬레이션 환경 구축, 에이전트 프로파일링 및 커뮤니케이션 전략 개발, 에이전트 역량 강화를 위한 메커니즘 연구에 집중되고 있습니다 [1]. 특히, 고장난 에이전트가 존재할 때 다중 에이전트 협업의 복원력을 분석하는 연구는 실제 시스템 운영에 중요한 시사점을 제공합니다 [2]. 다중 에이전트 환경에서 각 에이전트의 역할 정의, 상호 작용 방식, 그리고 협업 과정에서의 문제 해결 능력이 시스템 전체의 성능에 큰 영향을 미치기 때문입니다. 예를 들어, 재난 상황 시뮬레이션에서 각 에이전트는 소방관, 경찰관, 의료진 등의 역할을 수행하며, 서로 정보를 공유하고 협력하여 효율적인 구조 활동을 수행할 수 있습니다.
      
      **인간-에이전트 시스템의 시너지 효과:**
      
      LLM 기반의 인간-에이전트 시스템은 인간의 직관, 창의성, 윤리적 판단 능력과 LLM의 정보 처리 능력, 자동화 능력, 확장성을 결합하여 시스템 성능을 극대화합니다 [5]. 환경 프로파일링, 인간 피드백 활용, 협업/경쟁/공생 등의 다양한 상호 작용 유형, 오케스트레이션 패러다임, 커뮤니케이션 구조 등 다양한 구성 요소를 통해 인간과 에이전트 간의 효과적인 협력을 지원합니다 [5]. 이는 복잡하고 예측 불가능한 상황에서 인간의 판단력을 보조하고, 반복적이고 지루한 작업을 자동화하여 효율성을 높이는 데 기여합니다. 예를 들어, 의료 진단 시스템에서 LLM은 환자의 증상을 분석하고 가능성 있는 질병 목록을 제시하며, 의사는 LLM의 분석 결과를 바탕으로 최종 진단을 내릴 수 있습니다.
      
      **2024년 주요 트렌드:**
      
      2024년에는 더욱 복잡한 멀티 스텝 에이전트 개발, LLM 호출 사용의 효율성 증대, 품질 검사 통합이 주요 트렌드로 나타나고 있습니다 [3]. 이는 단순히 명령을 수행하는 에이전트를 넘어, 여러 단계를 거쳐 목표를 달성하고, 비용 효율적인 방식으로 작동하며, 오류를 최소화하는 에이전트에 대한 요구가 증가하고 있음을 시사합니다. 또한, AI가 개발자 도구에 통합되어 새로운 AI 에이전트 생성 기술이 등장하고 있다는 점은 AI 에이전트 개발의 진입 장벽을 낮추고, 더 많은 개발자들이 AI 에이전트 시스템 개발에 참여할 수 있도록 장려할 것으로 예상됩니다 [3].

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      2024년 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템 연구는 LLM의 활용 범위를 단순 텍스트 생성에서 의사 결정, 협업, 인간과의 협력으로 확장하고 있습니다. 특히, 다중 에이전트 시스템과 인간-에이전트 시스템은 LLM의 잠재력을 극대화하고, 실제 문제 해결에 기여할 수 있는 가능성을 보여줍니다.
      
      향후 연구는 다음과 같은 방향으로 진행될 필요가 있습니다.
      
      *   **에이전트의 윤리적 문제 해결 능력 강화:** LLM 에이전트가 사회적 편견을 학습하거나, 오해의 소지가 있는 정보를 제공하는 것을 방지하기 위한 연구가 필요합니다.
      *   **에이전트의 설명 가능성 향상:** 에이전트가 의사 결정을 내리는 과정을 투명하게 설명할 수 있도록 하는 연구는 사용자의 신뢰를 높이고, 오류 발생 시 원인을 파악하는 데 도움이 됩니다.
      *   **다양한 도메인에서의 적용 가능성 탐색:** LLM 에이전트 시스템을 의료, 교육, 금융 등 다양한 분야에 적용하여 실제 효용성을 검증하고, 개선점을 발굴해야 합니다.

## 상세 분석

**LLM 기반 에이전트의 역할 확대:**

LLM은 단순히 텍스트 생성 모델을 넘어, 지시 사항을 이해하고, 순차적인 작업을 관리하며, 피드백을 통해 스스로 적응하는 능력을 갖춘 의사 결정 에이전트로서 자리매김하고 있습니다 [1]. 많은 에이전트 구현체들이 LLM을 오케스트레이터로 활용하여 기존 API를 도구로 호출함으로써 프로세스를 효율화하고 있습니다 [1]. 이는 LLM이 특정 작업을 수행하기 위한 '두뇌' 역할을 수행하며, 외부 도구를 활용하여 실제 행동을 수행하는 방식으로 이해할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 여행 계획 에이전트는 LLM을 사용하여 사용자 요청을 분석하고, 항공편 검색 API, 호텔 예약 API 등을 호출하여 최적의 여행 계획을 수립할 수 있습니다.

**다중 에이전트 시스템의 진화:**

LLM 기반의 다중 에이전트 시스템 연구는 시뮬레이션 환경 구축, 에이전트 프로파일링 및 커뮤니케이션 전략 개발, 에이전트 역량 강화를 위한 메커니즘 연구에 집중되고 있습니다 [1]. 특히, 고장난 에이전트가 존재할 때 다중 에이전트 협업의 복원력을 분석하는 연구는 실제 시스템 운영에 중요한 시사점을 제공합니다 [2]. 다중 에이전트 환경에서 각 에이전트의 역할 정의, 상호 작용 방식, 그리고 협업 과정에서의 문제 해결 능력이 시스템 전체의 성능에 큰 영향을 미치기 때문입니다. 예를 들어, 재난 상황 시뮬레이션에서 각 에이전트는 소방관, 경찰관, 의료진 등의 역할을 수행하며, 서로 정보를 공유하고 협력하여 효율적인 구조 활동을 수행할 수 있습니다.

**인간-에이전트 시스템의 시너지 효과:**

LLM 기반의 인간-에이전트 시스템은 인간의 직관, 창의성, 윤리적 판단 능력과 LLM의 정보 처리 능력, 자동화 능력, 확장성을 결합하여 시스템 성능을 극대화합니다 [5]. 환경 프로파일링, 인간 피드백 활용, 협업/경쟁/공생 등의 다양한 상호 작용 유형, 오케스트레이션 패러다임, 커뮤니케이션 구조 등 다양한 구성 요소를 통해 인간과 에이전트 간의 효과적인 협력을 지원합니다 [5]. 이는 복잡하고 예측 불가능한 상황에서 인간의 판단력을 보조하고, 반복적이고 지루한 작업을 자동화하여 효율성을 높이는 데 기여합니다. 예를 들어, 의료 진단 시스템에서 LLM은 환자의 증상을 분석하고 가능성 있는 질병 목록을 제시하며, 의사는 LLM의 분석 결과를 바탕으로 최종 진단을 내릴 수 있습니다.

**2024년 주요 트렌드:**

2024년에는 더욱 복잡한 멀티 스텝 에이전트 개발, LLM 호출 사용의 효율성 증대, 품질 검사 통합이 주요 트렌드로 나타나고 있습니다 [3]. 이는 단순히 명령을 수행하는 에이전트를 넘어, 여러 단계를 거쳐 목표를 달성하고, 비용 효율적인 방식으로 작동하며, 오류를 최소화하는 에이전트에 대한 요구가 증가하고 있음을 시사합니다. 또한, AI가 개발자 도구에 통합되어 새로운 AI 에이전트 생성 기술이 등장하고 있다는 점은 AI 에이전트 개발의 진입 장벽을 낮추고, 더 많은 개발자들이 AI 에이전트 시스템 개발에 참여할 수 있도록 장려할 것으로 예상됩니다 [3].

While they share some common goals, their approaches and applications are distinct, yet complement each other in modern AI solutions. RAG Systems: Information-Centric RAG systems are designed to bolster an AI's knowledge base by integrating external information before generating responses. Picture RAG as a sophisticated librarian who: Searches through documents to find relevant information. Combines this information with the model's existing knowledge to provide informed responses. Grounds responses in specific, retrievable information, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs. The RAG process involves retrieving relevant data from a knowledge base using advanced techniques like vector search, then augmenting the AI's prompt with this context to generate coherent, fact-based answers. This method significantly reduces the risk of "hallucinations" where AI might generate incorrect information based solely on its training data. Sources: yourGpt aws Agent-Based Systems: Action-Oriented Agent-based systems, in contrast, focus on autonomous action-taking and decision-making. An AI agent acts more like a proactive assistant who: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps. Executes actions based on situational understanding, possibly using tools, APIs, or other external resources. Learns from outcomes to improve future actions, maintaining state and context over time. These systems are designed for tasks requiring multiple steps, interaction with various systems, and continuous learning from experience. Agents can plan, decide, and act autonomously, making them ideal for environments where dynamic decision-making is crucial. * Key Differences Purpose : RAG focuses on information retrieval and knowledge enhancement, while agents aim at task completion and action execution. Operation Mode : RAG operates in a single pass for information lookup and response, whereas agents engage in multi-step, iterative processes. State Management : RAG is generally stateless, focusing on the current query, while agents maintain state and context across interactions. Tool Usage : RAG primarily leverages knowledge bases and embeddings, but agents can utilize a wide array of tools, APIs, and functions. Combining Both Approaches The integration of RAG and agent-based systems leads to more powerful AI applications: Example: Intelligence Analysis : RAG Component : Retrieves documents, finds historical patterns, and provides factual context. Agent Component : Plans the investigation strategy, decides on tool usage, coordinates with other systems, maintains state, and executes queries across databases. When to Use Which Use RAG When : You require factual, verifiable information. The task is primarily about retrieving information. Accuracy and sourcing are crucial. Responses need to be grounded in specific documents. Use Agents When : Tasks involve multiple steps or require interaction with external systems. Decision-making processes are necessary. Maintaining context across interactions is needed. Use Both When : Complex tasks require both information retrieval and action execution. Informed decision-making with contextual awareness is needed. Tasks involve both research and practical execution in long-running processes.

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      RAG는 정보 검색 및 지식 증강에 초점을 맞춘 반면 [1], Agent 기반 접근법은 최신 정보를 기반으로 의사 결정을 내리는 데 목표를 둡니다 [1]. Agentic RAG는 다단계 추론, 실시간 의사 결정, 정보 검증을 위해 지능형 AI 에이전트를 활용하여 복잡한 작업에 더 적합합니다 [3].
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   RAG는 정보 검색 및 지식 향상에 중점을 둡니다 [1].
      *   Agent는 최신 정보를 바탕으로 정보에 입각한 의사 결정을 목표로 합니다 [1].
      *   Agentic RAG는 다단계 추론, 실시간 의사 결정 및 정보 검증을 위해 지능형 AI 에이전트를 사용합니다 [3].
      *   기존 RAG는 간단한 쿼리 기반 작업에 충분하지만, Agentic RAG는 복잡한 프로세스에 더 적합합니다 [3].
      *   Agentic RAG를 통해 AI는 능동적으로 행동하고 독립적인 실시간 의사 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다 [3].
      *   RAG는 정보 검색과 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)을 결합하여 관련 데이터를 검색하고 프롬프트를 보강하여 답변을 생성합니다 [1].
      *   RAG 시스템은 정보 중심적입니다 [1].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      ### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
      
      RAG는 사용자의 질문에 대한 답변을 생성하기 위해, 외부 지식 소스에서 관련 정보를 검색하여 언어 모델의 프롬프트를 보강하는 기술입니다 [1].  즉, 주어진 질문에 적절한 정보를 찾고, 이를 LLM에게 제공하여 더욱 정확하고 풍부한 답변을 얻도록 돕는 것이 핵심입니다. RAG 시스템은 주로 정보 검색 및 지식 증강에 초점을 맞추며, 시스템의 중심은 '정보'입니다 [1]. 이는 정보 검색의 정확성과 효율성이 RAG 시스템의 성능에 직접적인 영향을 미친다는 것을 의미합니다.
      
      ### Agent 기반 접근법 (Agentic RAG 포함)
      
      Agent 기반 접근법은 RAG와는 달리, 정보에 기반한 '의사 결정'에 더욱 중점을 둡니다 [1]. AI 에이전트는 단순히 정보를 검색하고 제공하는 데 그치지 않고, 주어진 목표를 달성하기 위해 능동적으로 계획을 수립하고 실행합니다. Agentic RAG는 이러한 Agent 기반 접근법에 RAG의 정보 검색 능력을 결합한 형태입니다 [3]. 즉, AI 에이전트가 필요한 정보를 RAG를 통해 검색하고, 이를 바탕으로 다단계 추론을 거쳐 실시간 의사 결정을 내릴 수 있도록 지원합니다.  Agentic RAG는 복잡한 문제 해결에 유용하며, AI가 독립적인 판단을 내리고 행동해야 하는 상황에 적합합니다 [3].
      
      ### RAG vs. Agentic RAG: 사용 시점 비교
      
      *   **단순 쿼리 기반 작업**: 간단한 질문에 대한 답변을 얻는 데는 기존의 RAG로 충분합니다 [3]. 예를 들어, "XX회사의 2023년 매출은 얼마인가?"와 같은 직접적인 질문에는 RAG를 사용하여 관련 문서를 검색하고, LLM이 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 답변을 생성하는 방식이 효율적입니다.
      
      *   **복잡한 멀티 스텝 프로세스**: 복잡한 문제 해결, 예를 들어, "XX회사의 경쟁사 분석 보고서를 작성하고, 경쟁 우위를 확보하기 위한 3가지 전략을 제안하시오"와 같은 작업에는 Agentic RAG가 더 적합합니다 [3]. 이 경우, AI 에이전트는 먼저 경쟁사 정보를 RAG를 통해 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 분석하여 경쟁 우위를 파악한 후, 이를 바탕으로 전략을 수립하는 과정을 거치게 됩니다. 이처럼 여러 단계의 추론과 의사 결정이 필요한 작업에는 Agentic RAG가 효과적입니다. Agentic RAG는 또한 정보의 유효성을 검증하고 오류를 수정하는 데에도 활용될 수 있습니다 [3].

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      RAG와 Agent 기반 접근법 (특히 Agentic RAG)는 각각 고유한 강점을 가지고 있으며, 해결하려는 문제의 복잡성에 따라 적절한 방법을 선택해야 합니다.  단순한 정보 검색 및 요약에는 RAG가 효율적이지만, 복잡한 추론, 의사 결정, 문제 해결에는 Agentic RAG가 더 효과적입니다.  Agentic RAG는 AI 시스템의 자율성과 능동성을 향상시켜, 다양한 산업 분야에서 더욱 혁신적인 서비스를 제공할 수 있도록 할 것입니다. 앞으로 Agentic RAG는 더욱 발전하여, 단순한 정보 제공을 넘어, 인간의 사고 과정을 모방하고, 복잡한 문제에 대한 창의적인 해결책을 제시하는 데 기여할 것으로 기대됩니다. 다만, Agentic RAG의 복잡성으로 인해 발생하는 개발 및 운영 비용, 그리고 AI 에이전트의 의사 결정 과정에 대한 투명성 확보는 해결해야 할 과제입니다.
