      ## 핵심 요약
      
      LangGraph와 CrewAI는 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축을 위한 프레임워크이지만, 접근 방식과 장단점에서 뚜렷한 차이를 보인다. CrewAI는 빠른 설정과 직관적인 팀 협업에 중점을 둔 반면, LangGraph는 복잡한 워크플로우의 사용자 정의와 확장성에 더 중점을 둔다.

      *   CrewAI는 에이전트가 특정 역할을 수행하는 역할 기반 모델을 사용하여 워크플로우 시각화를 단순화한다 [1], [3].

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      RAG는 정적인 내부 데이터를 활용하여 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 적합하며, Agent 기반 접근법은 목표 지향적인 추론과 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 더 큰 유연성을 제공합니다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)는 특히 정적인 콘텐츠를 가진 내부 데이터를 사용하여 빠르고 정확한 답변을 제공하는 데 적합합니다 [2].
      *   Agentic RAG는 목표 지향적인 추론 및 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 유리하며, 기존 RAG보다 더 큰 유연성을 제공합니다 [3].
      *   RAG는 LLM을 외부 지식으로 강화하는 반면, AI Agent는 의사 결정 및 행동 실행을 관리합니다 [2].
      *   Agentic RAG는 기존 RAG와 달리 쿼리 정확도를 향상시키기 위해 쿼리를 개선합니다. 기존 RAG는 더 간단한 검색 및 정적 지식에 의존합니다 [1].
