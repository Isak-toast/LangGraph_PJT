      ## Key Findings
      - CrewAI focuses on collaborative agent teams with specific roles and communication strategies [1].
      - LangGraph provides a graph-based, state-driven workflow engine for building structured multi-agent systems [1], [3], [9], [11].
      - CrewAI allows for faster initial setup than LangGraph due to its role-based, YAML-configurable approach [3].
      - CrewAI agents delegate tasks and collaborate to achieve shared goals [2], [18].
      - LangGraph's workflow is programmatically hardcoded [10].
      
      ## Detailed Information
      
      - **CrewAI**: Designed for multi-agent systems, CrewAI features abstractions that facilitate agent collaboration [1], [2]. Agents in CrewAI setups communicate, delegate tasks, and operate in parallel [2], [18]. Its role-based approach allows for quick setup [3], and the framework is suited for industries requiring high-level collaboration [18]. CrewAI emphasizes role assignment, workflow orchestration, and contextual knowledge integration [17].
      
      - **LangGraph**: LangGraph employs a graph-based structure for managing multi-agent workflows [1], [9], [11], using a `StateGraph` to represent the system [9]. This approach enables agents to make decisions based on dynamic states [11]. Unlike adaptive or learning systems, LangGraph's workflow is programmatically hardcoded, with each node representing a function in code [10].
      
      - **Comparison**: CrewAI facilitates faster initial setups using a YAML-configurable approach [3]. In contrast, LangGraph emphasizes a structured, state-driven methodology [1], [9], [11] where workflows are explicitly defined [10].

      CrewAI와 LangGraph는 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축을 위한 각각 다른 접근 방식을 제공한다.
      
      *   **CrewAI**: CrewAI는 에이전트 간의 협업을 용이하게 하는 추상화를 특징으로 하는 멀티 에이전트 시스템을 위해 설계되었다 [1], [2]. CrewAI 설정의 에이전트는 통신하고, 작업을 위임하며, 병렬로 작동한다 [2], [18]. 역할 기반 접근 방식은 빠른 설정을 가능하게 하며 [3], 이 프레임워크는 고도의 협업이 필요한 산업에 적합하다 [18]. CrewAI는 역할 할당, 워크플로우 오케스트레이션 및 컨텍스트 지식 통합을 강조한다 [17]. 즉, CrewAI는 여러 에이전트가 각자의 전문성을 활용하여 공동의 목표를 달성하는 데 초점을 맞춘다. 예를 들어, 리서치 에이전트, 글쓰기 에이전트, 편집 에이전트 등으로 구성된 팀을 구성하여 보고서를 작성하는 시나리오에 적합하다. YAML 기반 설정은 직관적이며 빠르게 프로토타입을 제작할 수 있도록 돕는다.
      
      *   **LangGraph**: LangGraph는 멀티 에이전트 워크플로우 관리를 위해 그래프 기반 구조를 사용하며 [1], [9], [11], `StateGraph`를 사용하여 시스템을 나타낸다 [9]. 이 접근 방식을 통해 에이전트는 동적 상태를 기반으로 의사 결정을 내릴 수 있다 [11]. 적응형 또는 학습 시스템과 달리 LangGraph의 워크플로우는 프로그래밍 방식으로 하드 코딩되며 각 노드는 코드의 함수를 나타낸다 [10]. 즉, LangGraph는 에이전트 간의 상호 작용을 엄격하게 정의하고 제어할 수 있는 환경을 제공한다. 복잡하고 예측 가능한 워크플로우가 필요한 시스템에 적합하며, 각 단계별 의사 결정 과정을 명확하게 정의할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 복잡한 데이터 처리 파이프라인이나, 특정 규칙과 조건에 따라 에이전트 간 작업 흐름이 결정되는 시스템에 유용하다.
      
      *   **비교 분석**: CrewAI는 YAML 설정 방식을 사용하여 초기 설정을 더 빠르게 할 수 있다 [3]. 반면에 LangGraph는 워크플로우가 명시적으로 정의된 [10] 구조화된 상태 기반 방법론을 강조한다 [1], [9], [11]. CrewAI는 자연스러운 협업을 장려하는 반면, LangGraph는 더 엄격한 제어와 예측 가능한 실행을 제공한다. 또한, LangGraph는 에이전트 상태를 명확하게 관리하고 추적할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 하지만 LangGraph는 워크플로우를 코드로 정의해야 하므로 유연성이 떨어지고, 초기 설정 및 디버깅에 더 많은 노력이 필요할 수 있다.

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      CrewAI와 LangGraph는 각각의 장단점을 가지고 있다. CrewAI는 빠른 프로토타입 제작과 협업 중심의 시스템 구축에 유리하며, LangGraph는 엄격하게 정의된 워크플로우와 상태 관리가 필요한 시스템에 적합하다. 따라서, 프로젝트의 요구 사항과 목표에 따라 적절한 프레임워크를 선택해야 한다.
      
      *   **CrewAI**: 빠른 개발과 협업적인 멀티 에이전트 시스템을 구축하고 싶다면 CrewAI가 좋은 선택이다. 하지만 복잡한 워크플로우 관리나 상태 관리가 필요하다면 다른 옵션을 고려해야 한다.
      
      *   **LangGraph**: 복잡하고 예측 가능한 워크플로우를 구축하고, 에이전트 상태를 명확하게 관리해야 한다면 LangGraph가 더 적합하다. 하지만 초기 설정 및 유지 관리에 더 많은 노력이 필요하다는 점을 고려해야 한다.
      
      궁극적으로, CrewAI와 LangGraph는 서로 보완적인 기술이며, 두 프레임워크의 장점을 결합하여 사용하는 것도 가능하다. 예를 들어, CrewAI를 사용하여 에이전트 팀을 구성하고, LangGraph를 사용하여 팀 내 작업 흐름을 정의하는 방식이다. 프로젝트의 복잡성과 요구 사항을 신중하게 고려하여 가장 적합한 아키텍처를 선택하는 것이 중요하다.

      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   2024년과 2025년 초는 LLM 아키텍처, 학습 방법, 배포 전략의 획기적인 발전으로 LLM 진화의 중요한 시기이다 [1].
      *   개발자들은 멀티 스텝 에이전트 개발, LLM 호출 사용량 최적화를 통한 효율성 향상, 피드백 및 평가를 활용한 품질 보증에 주력했다 [1].
      *   기반 모델(Foundation Model)은 여전히 기업 투자의 상당 부분을 차지하며, LLM 레이어에 35억 달러의 투자가 이루어졌다 [3].
      *   소프트웨어 엔지니어링 도메인에 다중 LLM 기반 에이전트가 적용되는 사례가 늘고 있다 [3].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      **1. LLM 발전의 주요 동향 (2024-2025):**
      
      2024년과 2025년 초는 LLM 기술 발전에 있어 변곡점이다 [1].  이는 아키텍처, 학습 방법, 그리고 배포 전략 전반에 걸친 혁신에 기인한다. 단순히 모델의 크기를 키우는 것을 넘어, 특정 작업에 더욱 효율적이고 정확하게 대응할 수 있도록 모델 자체를 개선하는 데 초점이 맞춰지고 있다.  특히, 이전에는 단일 단계로 처리하기 어려웠던 복잡한 작업을 여러 단계로 나누어 처리하는 멀티 스텝 에이전트 개발이 활발히 진행되고 있다 [1].
      
      **2. 개발자들의 주요 관심사:**
      
      2024년 LLM 에이전트 시스템 개발자들은 다음 세 가지 주요 목표를 추구했다 [1]:
      
      *   **복잡성 증가 (멀티 스텝 에이전트):**  하나의 LLM이 처리하기 어려운 복잡한 작업을 여러 단계로 분할하여 처리하는 에이전트 개발에 집중했다.  이는 더 정교하고 복잡한 문제 해결 능력을 가능하게 한다.
      *   **효율성 향상 (LLM 호출 최적화):** LLM 호출 횟수를 줄이거나, 불필요한 연산을 줄이는 등 LLM 사용의 효율성을 높이는 데 주력했다. 이는 비용 절감과 응답 속도 향상으로 이어진다.
      *   **품질 보증 (피드백 및 평가 활용):** LLM 에이전트의 성능을 평가하고, 사용자 피드백을 반영하여 시스템의 품질을 개선하는 데 노력을 기울였다. 이는 사용자 만족도 향상과 시스템 신뢰도 증가에 기여한다.
      
      **3. 기반 모델(Foundation Model)의 영향력:**
      
      기반 모델은 여전히 LLM 생태계에서 지배적인 위치를 차지하고 있으며, 막대한 기업 투자를 유치하고 있다 [3]. 특히 LLM 레이어에 집중된 투자는 기반 모델의 지속적인 발전과 성능 향상을 뒷받침하고 있으며, 이는 다양한 응용 분야에서 LLM의 활용 가능성을 더욱 확대하고 있다. 기반 모델은 LLM 에이전트 시스템 개발의 기반이 되며, 특정 목적에 맞게 미세 조정(Fine-tuning)되어 사용된다.
      
      **4. 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야의 다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템 활용 증가:**
      
      소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야에서 다중 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템의 활용이 점차 증가하고 있다 [3]. 이는 코드 생성, 버그 수정, 문서 작성 등 다양한 작업에서 LLM의 도움을 받아 생산성을 향상시키고, 개발 과정을 자동화하는 데 기여한다.  다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템은 각 LLM의 강점을 활용하여 작업을 분담하고 협력함으로써, 단일 LLM으로는 달성하기 어려운 복잡한 문제 해결 능력을 제공한다.  예를 들어, 하나의 LLM은 코드 생성에 특화되고, 다른 LLM은 코드 검토 및 버그 탐지에 특화될 수 있다.

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      2024년은 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템의 발전에 중요한 전환점이 되는 해이며, 멀티 스텝 에이전트, 효율성 향상, 품질 검증이라는 세 가지 주요 트렌드가 두드러지게 나타났다. 특히 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야에서 다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템의 활용이 증가하면서, LLM 기술이 실제 산업 현장에서 적용되는 사례가 늘고 있음을 확인할 수 있다.  앞으로 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템은 더욱 복잡하고 정교한 문제 해결 능력을 갖추게 될 것이며, 다양한 분야에서 생산성 향상과 자동화에 기여할 것으로 예상된다.  다만, LLM의 환각 현상(Hallucination), 편향성(Bias), 그리고 윤리적인 문제에 대한 지속적인 연구와 개선이 필요하며, LLM 에이전트 시스템의 안정성과 신뢰성을 확보하는 것이 중요한 과제이다.

   └─ Feedback: The response provides a good overview of the trends in LLM-based agent systems in 2024, covering multi-step agents, efficiency improvements, and quality validation. It touches upon the increasing use in software engineering. However, the 'accuracy' is difficult to verify due to redacted URLs. Also, while the response is mostly relevant, a deeper dive into specific examples or case studies within each trend would enhance the completeness. The conclusion is a bit generic.

기반 모델은 여전히 LLM 생태계에서 지배적인 위치를 차지하고 있으며, 막대한 기업 투자를 유치하고 있다 [3]. 특히 LLM 레이어에 집중된 투자는 기반 모델의 지속적인 발전과 성능 향상을 뒷받침하고 있으며, 이는 다양한 응용 분야에서 LLM의 활용 가능성을 더욱 확대하고 있다. 기반 모델은 LLM 에이전트 시스템 개발의 기반이 되며, 특정 목적에 맞게 미세 조정(Fine-tuning)되어 사용된다.

**4. 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야의 다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템 활용 증가:**

소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야에서 다중 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템의 활용이 점차 증가하고 있다 [3]. 이는 코드 생성, 버그 수정, 문서 작성 등 다양한 작업에서 LLM의 도움을 받아 생산성을 향상시키고, 개발 과정을 자동화하는 데 기여한다.  다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템은 각 LLM의 강점을 활용하여 작업을 분담하고 협력함으로써, 단일 LLM으로는 달성하기 어려운 복잡한 문제 해결 능력을 제공한다.  예를 들어, 하나의 LLM은 코드 생성에 특화되고, 다른 LLM은 코드 검토 및 버그 탐지에 특화될 수 있다.

## 결론 및 평가

2024년은 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템의 발전에 중요한 전환점이 되는 해이며, 멀티 스텝 에이전트, 효율성 향상, 품질 검증이라는 세 가지 주요 트렌드가 두드러지게 나타났다. 특히 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야에서 다중 LLM 에이전트 시스템의 활용이 증가하면서, LLM 기술이 실제 산업 현장에서 적용되는 사례가 늘고 있음을 확인할 수 있다.  앞으로 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템은 더욱 복잡하고 정교한 문제 해결 능력을 갖추게 될 것이며, 다양한 분야에서 생산성 향상과 자동화에 기여할 것으로 예상된다.  다만, LLM의 환각 현상(Hallucination), 편향성(Bias), 그리고 윤리적인 문제에 대한 지속적인 연구와 개선이 필요하며, LLM 에이전트 시스템의 안정성과 신뢰성을 확보하는 것이 중요한 과제이다.

      ## Key Findings
      - Traditional RAG employs a static workflow, while Agentic RAG uses autonomous agents to analyze and refine responses in real-time [1], [2], [3].
      - RAG improves LLMs by connecting them to external data sources [3].
      - Agentic RAG expands the concept of retrieval augmentation to multi-step, autonomous agent interactions [17].
      - RAG evaluation focuses on retrieval relevance, answer faithfulness, and correctness, whereas agent evaluation assesses trajectory-level actions [18].
      - Traditional RAG is generally faster and less expensive than Agentic RAG [19].
      
      ## Detailed Information
      
      **Core Concepts**
      - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines information retrieval with large language models to generate answers [9]. It enables AI agents to find and use dynamic, constantly changing data [10].
      - Both RAG and Agentic RAG enhance LLMs by allowing them to access and generate context-aware information [3].
      
      **Traditional RAG vs. Agentic RAG**
      - Traditional RAG uses a static workflow [1]. Agentic RAG incorporates autonomous agents to analyze and refine responses dynamically [2]. This represents a shift from passive assistance to active analysis [2].
      - Agentic RAG broadens the concept of retrieval augmentation from single-turn interactions to multi-step agent interactions [17].
      - Agentic RAG agents plan, act, and reason [11]. A key limitation of traditional RAG is that it's passive, only answering queries without taking action [11].
      
      **Evaluation**
      - RAG evaluation focuses on retrieval relevance, faithfulness to sources, and correctness [18]. Agent evaluation requires trajectory-level assessment to determine if the agent chose the right actions [18].
      - Traditional RAG is simpler (query, retrieve, generate), typically faster, and less expensive [19]. Agentic RAG is dynamic, using RAG as a tool, and managing context over time [19].

      ## 핵심 요약
      RAG는 외부 데이터 소스를 활용하여 LLM의 답변 품질을 향상시키는 기술이며, Agent 기반 접근법은 자율적인 에이전트를 통해 RAG 프로세스를 더욱 능동적으로 관리하고 개선합니다. Agentic RAG는 기존 RAG보다 복잡하지만, 더욱 정교하고 상황에 맞는 답변을 생성할 수 있습니다 [1], [2].
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      * 전통적인 RAG는 정적인 워크플로우를 사용하는 반면, Agentic RAG는 자율적인 에이전트가 실시간으로 응답을 분석하고 개선합니다 [1], [2], [3].
      * RAG는 LLM을 외부 데이터 소스와 연결하여 성능을 향상시킵니다 [3].
      * Agentic RAG는 검색 증강의 개념을 다단계, 자율적 에이전트 상호 작용으로 확장합니다 [17].
      * RAG 평가는 검색 관련성, 답변 충실성 및 정확성에 중점을 두는 반면, 에이전트 평가는 궤적 수준의 작업을 평가합니다 [18].
      * 전통적인 RAG는 일반적으로 Agentic RAG보다 빠르고 비용이 저렴합니다 [19].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)의 기본 개념**
      
      RAG는 정보 검색과 대규모 언어 모델 (LLM)을 결합하여 답변을 생성하는 기술입니다 [9].  RAG는 AI 에이전트가 역동적이고 끊임없이 변화하는 데이터를 찾아서 사용할 수 있도록 합니다 [10]. 간단히 말해, LLM에게 질문하기 전에 관련 정보를 검색하여 LLM이 더 나은 답변을 생성할 수 있도록 돕는 방식입니다.
      
      **전통적인 RAG vs. Agentic RAG**
      
      전통적인 RAG는 미리 정의된 단계에 따라 작동하는 정적인 워크플로우를 사용합니다 [1].  반면 Agentic RAG는 자율적인 에이전트들을 활용하여 응답을 동적으로 분석하고 개선합니다 [2]. 이것은 단순한 지원에서 능동적인 분석으로의 전환을 의미합니다 [2]. Agentic RAG는 검색 증강 개념을 단일 턴 상호 작용에서 다단계 에이전트 상호 작용으로 확장합니다 [17].
      
      Agentic RAG 에이전트는 계획하고, 행동하고, 추론합니다 [11]. 전통적인 RAG의 주요 한계는 수동적이라는 점입니다. 즉, 조치를 취하지 않고 쿼리에만 응답한다는 것입니다 [11]. 예를 들어, 전통적인 RAG는 단순히 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 질문에 답변하지만, Agentic RAG는 필요한 경우 추가 정보를 검색하거나, 답변을 개선하기 위한 추가적인 단계를 수행할 수 있습니다.  Agentic RAG는 RAG를 하나의 도구로 사용하여 더 복잡한 작업을 수행하는 AI 에이전트를 구축하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.
      
      **평가 방법**
      
      RAG 평가는 검색 관련성, 소스에 대한 충실성 및 정확성에 중점을 둡니다 [18]. 에이전트 평가는 에이전트가 올바른 작업을 선택했는지 확인하기 위해 궤적 수준 평가가 필요합니다 [18]. 전통적인 RAG는 더 간단하고 (쿼리, 검색, 생성), 일반적으로 더 빠르고 저렴합니다 [19]. Agentic RAG는 동적이며, RAG를 도구로 사용하고, 시간 경과에 따라 컨텍스트를 관리합니다 [19]. 따라서 Agentic RAG 시스템은 각 에이전트의 액션 플랜, 각 단계의 정확성 등을 평가해야 합니다.

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      RAG와 Agent 기반 접근법은 모두 LLM의 성능을 향상시키기 위한 기술이지만, 적용 방식과 복잡성에서 차이가 있습니다. 전통적인 RAG는 빠르고 간단하게 외부 정보를 활용하여 LLM의 답변을 보완하는 데 적합합니다. 반면, Agentic RAG는 더 복잡한 문제 해결이나, 지속적인 상호작용이 필요한 상황에서 더욱 유용합니다.
      
      **언제 어떤 접근법을 사용해야 할까요?**
      
      *   **전통적인 RAG:**
          *   빠르고 효율적인 답변 생성이 중요할 때.
          *   단순한 질의 응답 시나리오.
          *   비용 효율성이 중요한 경우.
          *   예: 제품 설명서 검색, 간단한 질문에 대한 답변.
      
      *   **Agentic RAG:**
          *   복잡한 추론 및 계획이 필요한 작업.
          *   다단계 의사 결정이 필요한 경우.
          *   컨텍스트를 유지하고 상황에 따라 적응해야 하는 경우.
          *   예: 고객 지원 챗봇, 복잡한 데이터 분석, 코드 생성.
      
      Agentic RAG는 더 많은 컴퓨팅 자원을 필요로 하고 개발 복잡성이 높지만, 더 강력하고 유연한 AI 시스템을 구축할 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있습니다. 따라서, 프로젝트의 요구 사항과 제약 조건을 신중하게 고려하여 적절한 접근 방식을 선택해야 합니다.  궁극적으로는 해결하고자 하는 문제의 복잡성과 필요한 성능 수준에 따라 RAG와 Agent 기반 접근법 중 적합한 것을 선택하거나, 두 가지를 결합하는 것이 가장 효과적일 수 있습니다.

**전통적인 RAG vs. Agentic RAG**

전통적인 RAG는 미리 정의된 단계에 따라 작동하는 정적인 워크플로우를 사용합니다 [1].  반면 Agentic RAG는 자율적인 에이전트들을 활용하여 응답을 동적으로 분석하고 개선합니다 [2]. 이것은 단순한 지원에서 능동적인 분석으로의 전환을 의미합니다 [2]. Agentic RAG는 검색 증강 개념을 단일 턴 상호 작용에서 다단계 에이전트 상호 작용으로 확장합니다 [17].

Agentic RAG 에이전트는 계획하고, 행동하고, 추론합니다 [11]. 전통적인 RAG의 주요 한계는 수동적이라는 점입니다. 즉, 조치를 취하지 않고 쿼리에만 응답한다는 것입니다 [11]. 예를 들어, 전통적인 RAG는 단순히 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 질문에 답변하지만, Agentic RAG는 필요한 경우 추가 정보를 검색하거나, 답변을 개선하기 위한 추가적인 단계를 수행할 수 있습니다.  Agentic RAG는 RAG를 하나의 도구로 사용하여 더 복잡한 작업을 수행하는 AI 에이전트를 구축하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.

**평가 방법**

RAG 평가는 검색 관련성, 소스에 대한 충실성 및 정확성에 중점을 둡니다 [18]. 에이전트 평가는 에이전트가 올바른 작업을 선택했는지 확인하기 위해 궤적 수준 평가가 필요합니다 [18]. 전통적인 RAG는 더 간단하고 (쿼리, 검색, 생성), 일반적으로 더 빠르고 저렴합니다 [19]. Agentic RAG는 동적이며, RAG를 도구로 사용하고, 시간 경과에 따라 컨텍스트를 관리합니다 [19]. 따라서 Agentic RAG 시스템은 각 에이전트의 액션 플랜, 각 단계의 정확성 등을 평가해야 합니다.
