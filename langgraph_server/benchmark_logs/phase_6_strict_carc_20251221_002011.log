Instead of coding every rule or path, you can now create agents that handle tasks and coordinate with each other. LangGraph and CrewAI tackle this in different ways. Let’s look at how each framework works, what they do well, and where they make the most sense in production. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source orchestration framework for building stateful, long-running agents. It’s part of the LangChain ecosystem but can also run independently. Workflows in LangGraph are modeled as state graphs , where nodes represent actions and edges define control flow. Each node takes in the current state, performs an operation, like calling a language model, querying a database, or executing custom logic, and returns an updated state. This structure keeps execution paths clear and easy to debug. LangGraph is built for teams that need reliable, production-grade automation with clear control and visibility. It’s a good fit for workflows that require consistency and human oversight, like customer operations or document processing. Core Capabilities Durable execution : Workflows can recover automatically from crashes or restarts, resuming from the last checkpoint. This is useful for long-running processes like approvals or batch jobs. Human-in-the-loop : You can pause execution at any point, wait for human input, and resume later with that input included. State is stored persistently, so workflows can pause indefinitely. Memory management : Supports both short-term and long-term memory. Agents retain conversation history and past context across sessions for consistent decision-making. LangSmith integration : Provides debugging tools and observability. You can trace execution paths, inspect state transitions, and monitor runtime metrics. Flexible agent creation: Use create_react_agent for quick setup or build custom graphs manually for full control over logic and flow. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is a Python framework built independently of LangChain. It’s open source under the MIT license and focuses on multi-agent coordination. The framework offers two main approaches: Crews for autonomous agent collaboration and Flows for event-driven workflow control. Crews organize agents by roles such as researcher, writer, or analyst and assign them tasks. Flows manage complex execution paths with conditional branching and state management. CrewAI focuses on speed and simplicity. It needs less setup than graph-based frameworks, so you can build multi-agent systems with only a small amount of code. Core Capabilities CrewAI handles multi-agent workflows through key features: Agent structure: Work is organized around agents with roles, goals, and backstories that define how they behave. Tasks assign objectives and specify which agent handles them. Work can run sequentially or in hierarchical mode, where a manager agent delegates tasks. Autonomous operation: Agents handle tasks independently. They choose tools, request help from other agents, and escalate tasks they can’t complete. This coordination comes from configuration rather than hardcoded routing. Flows for control: Event-driven workflows use decorators like @start , @ listen , and @router . Conditions can be combined with or _ and and _ for more complex triggers, allowing a mix of autonomous agents and structured control in the same application. Tool integration: Python functions can be marked with @tool , making them accessible to agents. CrewAI manages discovery and parameter extraction automatically. Enterprise features: The AMP Suite provides tracing, observability, a control plane, and support options, with the Crew Control Plane available for free trials. LangGraph vs CrewAI: Key Differences 1. Framework Maturity &amp; Development Lineage LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem and benefits from its established tools and production deployments. The team maintains compatibility with major LLM providers and actively addresses edge cases. CrewAI is newer and developed by an independent team. Features are released quickly, though documentation can lag. Community activity is strong, and bleeding-edge features often appear first, but LangGraph is generally more stable for production systems. 2. Workflow Deployment Patterns LangGraph relies on explicit graph definitions. You build a StateGraph, add nodes, define edges with conditions, and compile the graph. This approach gives precise control but requires upfront design. CrewAI uses a higher-level, declarative approach. Agents and tasks are defined in Python or YAML, then run in a Crew. Flows provide event-driven control with decorators. This reduces boilerplate but hides some execution details. Graphs help with complex branching, while CrewAI works well for simpler sequences. 3. Human-in-the-Loop Capabilities LangGraph handles human input through interrupt nodes and persistent state. Workflows can pause, wait for approval, and resume without losing context. State persists indefinitely, and checkpoints let you audit decisions. CrewAI supports human input via callbacks or a human_input parameter. Agents can request input, but long pauses require custom state handling. 4. Parallel Agent Execution and Throttling LangGraph runs nodes in parallel if there are no dependencies. You control concurrency through graph design. Rate limiting requires wrapping calls or adding delay nodes. CrewAI supports asynchronous execution out of the box. Multiple agents can run in parallel, with configurable concurrency limits. Async support makes I/O-heavy workflows more efficient. 5. Enterprise Compliance and Security Neither framework handles authentication, authorization, or audit logging. LangGraph stores state in memory, SQLite, or PostgreSQL, letting you control encryption and sensitive data. CrewAI uses the Python process permissions and the AMP Suite for observability and control, but access control needs to be implemented separately. Both require custom solutions for compliance, user management, and audit trails. Integration Support LangGraph Integrations LangGraph connects with LangChain tools, including LLMs like OpenAI and Anthropic, vector databases such as Pinecone and Chroma, and document loaders. Memory integrations preserve context between nodes, and tool actions like web search, SQL queries, API calls, and Python execution are supported. LangSmith adds tracing, metrics, and visualization, with paid plans from $39/month. CrewAI Integrations CrewAI works with LLMs via direct API calls or LangChain wrappers, letting each agent use a different model. Tools are exposed with the @tool decorator, including web search, file operations, and HTTP requests. FastAPI integration allows workflows to run as REST APIs, with async support for efficient execution.

Instead of coding every rule or path, you can now create agents that handle tasks and coordinate with each other. LangGraph and CrewAI tackle this in different ways. Let’s look at how each framework works, what they do well, and where they make the most sense in production. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source orchestration framework for building stateful, long-running agents. It’s part of the LangChain ecosystem but can also run independently. Workflows in LangGraph are modeled as state graphs , where nodes represent actions and edges define control flow. Each node takes in the current state, performs an operation, like calling a language model, querying a database, or executing custom logic, and returns an updated state. This structure keeps execution paths clear and easy to debug. LangGraph is built for teams that need reliable, production-grade automation with clear control and visibility. It’s a good fit for workflows that require consistency and human oversight, like customer operations or document processing. Core Capabilities Durable execution : Workflows can recover automatically from crashes or restarts, resuming from the last checkpoint. This is useful for long-running processes like approvals or batch jobs. Human-in-the-loop : You can pause execution at any point, wait for human input, and resume later with that input included. State is stored persistently, so workflows can pause indefinitely. Memory management : Supports both short-term and long-term memory. Agents retain conversation history and past context across sessions for consistent decision-making. LangSmith integration : Provides debugging tools and observability. You can trace execution paths, inspect state transitions, and monitor runtime metrics. Flexible agent creation: Use create_react_agent for quick setup or build custom graphs manually for full control over logic and flow. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is a Python framework built independently of LangChain. It’s open source under the MIT license and focuses on multi-agent coordination. The framework offers two main approaches: Crews for autonomous agent collaboration and Flows for event-driven workflow control. Crews organize agents by roles such as researcher, writer, or analyst and assign them tasks. Flows manage complex execution paths with conditional branching and state management. CrewAI focuses on speed and simplicity. It needs less setup than graph-based frameworks, so you can build multi-agent systems with only a small amount of code. Core Capabilities CrewAI handles multi-agent workflows through key features: Agent structure: Work is organized around agents with roles, goals, and backstories that define how they behave. Tasks assign objectives and specify which agent handles them. Work can run sequentially or in hierarchical mode, where a manager agent delegates tasks. Autonomous operation: Agents handle tasks independently. They choose tools, request help from other agents, and escalate tasks they can’t complete. This coordination comes from configuration rather than hardcoded routing. Flows for control: Event-driven workflows use decorators like @start , @ listen , and @router . Conditions can be combined with or _ and and _ for more complex triggers, allowing a mix of autonomous agents and structured control in the same application. Tool integration: Python functions can be marked with @tool , making them accessible to agents. CrewAI manages discovery and parameter extraction automatically. Enterprise features: The AMP Suite provides tracing, observability, a control plane, and support options, with the Crew Control Plane available for free trials. LangGraph vs CrewAI: Key Differences 1. Framework Maturity &amp; Development Lineage LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem and benefits from its established tools and production deployments. The team maintains compatibility with major LLM providers and actively addresses edge cases. CrewAI is newer and developed by an independent team. Features are released quickly, though documentation can lag. Community activity is strong, and bleeding-edge features often appear first, but LangGraph is generally more stable for production systems. 2. Workflow Deployment Patterns LangGraph relies on explicit graph definitions. You build a StateGraph, add nodes, define edges with conditions, and compile the graph. This approach gives precise control but requires upfront design. CrewAI uses a higher-level, declarative approach. Agents and tasks are defined in Python or YAML, then run in a Crew. Flows provide event-driven control with decorators. This reduces boilerplate but hides some execution details. Graphs help with complex branching, while CrewAI works well for simpler sequences. 3. Human-in-the-Loop Capabilities LangGraph handles human input through interrupt nodes and persistent state. Workflows can pause, wait for approval, and resume without losing context. State persists indefinitely, and checkpoints let you audit decisions. CrewAI supports human input via callbacks or a human_input parameter. Agents can request input, but long pauses require custom state handling. 4. Parallel Agent Execution and Throttling LangGraph runs nodes in parallel if there are no dependencies. You control concurrency through graph design. Rate limiting requires wrapping calls or adding delay nodes. CrewAI supports asynchronous execution out of the box. Multiple agents can run in parallel, with configurable concurrency limits. Async support makes I/O-heavy workflows more efficient. 5. Enterprise Compliance and Security Neither framework handles authentication, authorization, or audit logging. LangGraph stores state in memory, SQLite, or PostgreSQL, letting you control encryption and sensitive data. CrewAI uses the Python process permissions and the AMP Suite for observability and control, but access control needs to be implemented separately. Both require custom solutions for compliance, user management, and audit trails. Integration Support LangGraph Integrations LangGraph connects with LangChain tools, including LLMs like OpenAI and Anthropic, vector databases such as Pinecone and Chroma, and document loaders. Memory integrations preserve context between nodes, and tool actions like web search, SQL queries, API calls, and Python execution are supported. LangSmith adds tracing, metrics, and visualization, with paid plans from $39/month. CrewAI Integrations CrewAI works with LLMs via direct API calls or LangChain wrappers, letting each agent use a different model. Tools are exposed with the @tool decorator, including web search, file operations, and HTTP requests. FastAPI integration allows workflows to run as REST APIs, with async support for efficient execution.

Developers now want tools that can orchestrate multiple agents, manage shared state, and support complex workflows with branching, looping, and retries. Two notable frameworks leading this space are CrewAI and LangGraph. While CrewAI focuses on collaborative agent teams—where each agent has a specific role, goal, and communication strategy—LangGraph provides a graph-based workflow engine designed for building structured, resilient LLM applications. Both aim to simplify multi-agent development but approach the problem from different angles: CrewAI emphasizes team coordination, whereas LangGraph emphasizes stateful, production-ready execution. In this comparison, we’ll break down their core philosophies, features, and use cases to help you decide which framework better fits your AI development needs. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is an open-source, Python-based framework designed for orchestrating autonomous, collaborative AI agents, much like a digital team handling complex tasks. Each agent operates with a defined role, such as researcher, writer, or analyst, and works together within a structured crew to solve problems efficiently. CrewAI combines modularity with performance, offering both high-level simplicity and precise control over how agents interact. Through components like Crews and Flows, it supports dynamic collaboration while giving developers the ability to manage control flows, tasks, and environments with flexibility. Agents in CrewAI are set up with defined roles, goals, tools, and even personality through backstories. This is similar to how a human team organizes itself to divide work and minimize errors. The framework allows agents to work sequentially or in parallel, with coordination that ensures shared context and consistent progress. Built from the ground up without dependencies on other orchestration frameworks, CrewAI is lightweight, fast, and adaptable. It is a strong choice for creating enterprise-ready agent systems that can operate on-premise or in the cloud. Backed by an active developer community and growing educational resources, CrewAI makes it easier for teams to build AI solutions that go beyond single-agent capabilities. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source framework from the creators of LangChain, designed to help developers build advanced AI agents and workflows. Instead of following a fixed, linear sequence of steps, LangGraph organizes tasks into a graph structure. In this setup, each node represents a specific task, and the edges define how those tasks connect and pass information. This approach allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps, giving your AI workflows much more flexibility. One of LangGraph’s key strengths is its ability to handle long-running, stateful agents. These agents can pause, wait for input, and resume exactly where they left off, which is valuable for complex decision-making processes. Developers can also insert human checkpoints into a workflow, allowing for manual review or approval before moving forward. LangGraph is built for reliability in production. It integrates with monitoring and debugging tools like LangSmith, making it easier to trace actions, analyze performance, and understand how an agent reached a particular outcome. It also supports persistent memory, enabling agents to maintain context and learn from past interactions across sessions. By combining graph-based logic with strong state management and observability, LangGraph is well-suited for applications where workflows need to adapt dynamically, run continuously, and manage multiple decision paths. Whether it’s powering a multi-agent system, a virtual assistant with complex reasoning, or a workflow that needs to handle unexpected events gracefully, LangGraph provides the structure and tools to make it happen. CrewAI vs LangGraph : Key Differences CrewAI is purpose-built for orchestrating multiple autonomous agents that work together toward a shared goal. It emphasizes collaboration, with agents assigned distinct roles, goals, and tools to tackle different aspects of a task. Its design makes it easy to coordinate complex projects by dividing responsibilities and ensuring that each agent contributes to the final outcome. CrewAI is particularly effective when you want your agents to operate like a specialized team, working either sequentially or in parallel, with a clear structure guiding their interaction. LangGraph, in contrast, focuses on creating flexible, adaptive workflows for AI agents. It uses a graph-based execution model that allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps in a process. This makes it ideal for scenarios where the path to a solution is not strictly linear and may require adjusting actions based on changing inputs. LangGraph’s explicit state management and support for human checkpoints also make it well-suited for long-running, production-grade applications that demand reliability and transparency. Feature CrewAI LangGraph Focus Multi-agent collaboration Flexible multi-agent workflows Execution model Parallel task execution Graph-based execution State management Shared context with crew Explicit persistent state management Human-in-the-loop Possible with structured crew interactions Built-in checkpoints for human review Best use case Specialized agents working together Complex, dynamic workflows When to Use CrewAI CrewAI is the right choice when your project depends on multiple AI agents working together, each with a clearly defined role and responsibility. If you think of your application as a “digital team,” CrewAI gives you the structure to assign tasks, coordinate workflows, and ensure that every agent’s contribution aligns with the... [truncated]

      ## 상세 분석
      
      **코어 차이점:**
      
      CrewAI는 멀티 에이전트 시스템에서 에이전트 간의 협업을 위한 더 나은 추상화를 제공한다. 반면, LangGraph는 에이전트 조정을 위해 명시적인 그래프 설계를 요구한다 [4]. CrewAI는 초기 설정이 빠르고 사용자 친화적인 반면 [4], [2], LangGraph는 그래프 구조에 대한 더 깊은 이해를 요구하며 높은 유연성이 필요한 고급 사용자에게 적합하다 [4], [2].  이는 CrewAI가 학습 곡선이 낮고 간단한 사용 사례에 빠르게 적용할 수 있음을 의미하며, LangGraph는 초기 진입 장벽이 높지만, 더 복잡하고 세밀하게 제어해야 하는 상황에 더 강력한 도구를 제공한다는 것을 시사한다.
      
      **사용 사례:**
      
      LangGraph는 코드 생성 및 복잡한 멀티 에이전트 코딩 워크플로우에 특히 적합하다 [4], [2]. CrewAI는 협업이 필요한 시뮬레이션에 적합하다 [2]. LangGraph의 접근 방식은 더욱 견고하며 특히 엔터프라이즈 환경에서 안정적이고 추적 가능한 흐름에 적합하다 [4], [2]. LangGraph는 구조화된 NLP 워크플로우에서 우수한 성능을 보여주었다 [2]. CrewAI는 프로토타입 및 간단한 워크플로우에 더 적합하며, LangGraph는 안정성이 필요한 프로덕션 시스템에 더 적합하다 [4].  이러한 차이점은 프로젝트의 복잡성, 안정성 요구 사항, 그리고 최종 목표에 따라 적합한 프레임워크를 선택해야 함을 강조한다. 예를 들어, 실험적인 프로젝트나 간단한 자동화 작업에는 CrewAI가 더 적합할 수 있지만, 실제 서비스에 배포될 복잡한 시스템에는 LangGraph가 더 나은 선택이 될 수 있다.
      
      **기능 및 성능:**
      
      CrewAI는 강력한 Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) 기능을 포함한다 [4]. CrewAI는 팀 협업을 강조하는 반면, LangGraph는 상태 저장 및 프로덕션 준비 실행에 중점을 둔다 [4].  HitL 기능은 에이전트의 결정에 대한 인간의 개입이 중요한 경우에 CrewAI의 장점이 될 수 있다.  LangGraph의 상태 저장 기능은 장기적인 대화 흐름이나 복잡한 워크플로우를 관리하는 데 유용하다.
      
      **채택 및 개발:**
      
      CrewAI가 먼저 출시되었고 더 많은 GitHub 스타를 보유하고 있지만 [2], LangGraph는 더 빠른 개발 속도와 더 많은 월별 다운로드 수를 자랑한다 [2]. 이는 CrewAI가 더 많은 커뮤니티 지원을 받을 수 있으며, LangGraph는 빠르게 발전하고 있음을 의미한다. 사용자 선호도 측면에서는 엔지니어링 팀이 빠른 프로토타입 제작에는 CrewAI를 선호하고 복잡한 프로덕션 워크플로우에서 에이전트 개발에는 LangGraph를 선호한다 [4].

## 상세 분석

**코어 차이점:**

CrewAI는 멀티 에이전트 시스템에서 에이전트 간의 협업을 위한 더 나은 추상화를 제공한다. 반면, LangGraph는 에이전트 조정을 위해 명시적인 그래프 설계를 요구한다 [4]. CrewAI는 초기 설정이 빠르고 사용자 친화적인 반면 [4], [2], LangGraph는 그래프 구조에 대한 더 깊은 이해를 요구하며 높은 유연성이 필요한 고급 사용자에게 적합하다 [4], [2].  이는 CrewAI가 학습 곡선이 낮고 간단한 사용 사례에 빠르게 적용할 수 있음을 의미하며, LangGraph는 초기 진입 장벽이 높지만, 더 복잡하고 세밀하게 제어해야 하는 상황에 더 강력한 도구를 제공한다는 것을 시사한다.

**사용 사례:**

LangGraph는 코드 생성 및 복잡한 멀티 에이전트 코딩 워크플로우에 특히 적합하다 [4], [2]. CrewAI는 협업이 필요한 시뮬레이션에 적합하다 [2]. LangGraph의 접근 방식은 더욱 견고하며 특히 엔터프라이즈 환경에서 안정적이고 추적 가능한 흐름에 적합하다 [4], [2]. LangGraph는 구조화된 NLP 워크플로우에서 우수한 성능을 보여주었다 [2]. CrewAI는 프로토타입 및 간단한 워크플로우에 더 적합하며, LangGraph는 안정성이 필요한 프로덕션 시스템에 더 적합하다 [4].  이러한 차이점은 프로젝트의 복잡성, 안정성 요구 사항, 그리고 최종 목표에 따라 적합한 프레임워크를 선택해야 함을 강조한다. 예를 들어, 실험적인 프로젝트나 간단한 자동화 작업에는 CrewAI가 더 적합할 수 있지만, 실제 서비스에 배포될 복잡한 시스템에는 LangGraph가 더 나은 선택이 될 수 있다.

**기능 및 성능:**

CrewAI는 강력한 Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) 기능을 포함한다 [4]. CrewAI는 팀 협업을 강조하는 반면, LangGraph는 상태 저장 및 프로덕션 준비 실행에 중점을 둔다 [4].  HitL 기능은 에이전트의 결정에 대한 인간의 개입이 중요한 경우에 CrewAI의 장점이 될 수 있다.  LangGraph의 상태 저장 기능은 장기적인 대화 흐름이나 복잡한 워크플로우를 관리하는 데 유용하다.

**채택 및 개발:**

CrewAI가 먼저 출시되었고 더 많은 GitHub 스타를 보유하고 있지만 [2], LangGraph는 더 빠른 개발 속도와 더 많은 월별 다운로드 수를 자랑한다 [2]. 이는 CrewAI가 더 많은 커뮤니티 지원을 받을 수 있으며, LangGraph는 빠르게 발전하고 있음을 의미한다. 사용자 선호도 측면에서는 엔지니어링 팀이 빠른 프로토타입 제작에는 CrewAI를 선호하고 복잡한 프로덕션 워크플로우에서 에이전트 개발에는 LangGraph를 선호한다 [4].

## 결론 및 평가

CrewAI와 LangGraph는 각각 장단점을 가진 멀티 에이전트 프레임워크이다. CrewAI는 사용 편의성과 빠른 프로토타입 제작에 강점을 가지며, 특히 Human-in-the-Loop 기능이 필요한 경우에 유용하다. 반면, LangGraph는 복잡한 워크플로우와 프로덕션 환경에 적합하며, 안정성과 추적 가능성이 중요한 경우에 더 나은 선택이다. 따라서 프로젝트의 요구 사항과 엔지니어링 팀의 숙련도를 고려하여 적절한 프레임워크를 선택하는 것이 중요하다. 특히, 엔터프라이즈 환경에서 안정적인 서비스를 구축하고자 한다면 LangGraph가, 아이디어 검증이나 간단한 자동화에는 CrewAI가 더 적합할 것이다. 두 프레임워크 모두 활발하게 개발되고 있으므로, 지속적인 관심과 학습을 통해 최적의 활용 방안을 모색하는 것이 중요하다고 판단된다.

Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs, they have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically. Recently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or decision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable progress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the community with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to offer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems based on LLMs, as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to gain substantial insights on the following questions: What domains and environments do LLM-based multi-agents simulate? How are these agents profiled and how do they communicate? What mechanisms contribute to the growth of agents&#39; capacities? For those interested in delving into this field of study, we also summarize the commonly used datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient access. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-based multi-agent systems.

      • We searched across multiple sources, including peer-reviewed journals, preprints, and major AI venues such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, and TMLR, as well as indexing platforms such as Google Scholar. The search targeted papers published between 2023 and 2025, reflecting the recent surge of work on LLM-based agentic systems. Representative search terms included DS agents, LLM agents, multimodal agents, tool-using agents, trustworthy AI systems, and data science automation. This search window [...] multi-agent systems use multiple specialized LLMs such as a data collector, exploratory data analysis analyst, model builder, and report generator that coordinate through structured messaging, shared memory, or blackboard-style architectures (Zan et al., 2024; Ke et al., 2025) (see Fig. 2). These can be organized as peer-based systems, where agents with equal authority exchange information, or hierarchical systems, where a planner agent delegates tasks to worker agents and aggregates their [...] In the context of data science, LLM agents have been applied to tasks such as data exploration (Cheng et al., 2023), automated machine learning (Hassan et al., 2023), and visualization and reporting (Yu et al., 2024). The next section outlines how agent architectures have evolved from classical AI agents to modern LLM-based agents designed for complex reasoning and tool orchestration.
      • In 2025, the focus has shifted: from general-purpose LLMs to models tailored for specific industries and tasks. From simple assistants to autonomous agents that act on our behalf. This article explores what happened in 2024, and what to expect in the future of LLMs.  ## LLMs in 2024: A year of practical breakthroughs  ## Top LLM trends in 2025  ## Top LLM research papers in 2025  ## Final thoughts: Where LLMs go from here [...] One trend has become clear: progress in AGI won’t come from model size alone. It will come from better data, more grounded evaluation, and smarter infrastructure. We’ve seen LLMs pass the Turing test, agents learn by sharing skills, and multimodal models tackle emotional reasoning. But these leaps are powered by what happens behind the scenes: carefully calibrated benchmarks, human-verified supervision, and domain-specific training pipelines. [...] The global market for LLMs is growing fast – valued at $6.4 billion in 2024, it’s expected to reach $36.1 billion by 2030. Enterprises across finance, healthcare, law, and tech are adopting LLMs to improve automation, insights, and customer experience.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code, tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive, lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection, interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability, governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency, transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents. agentic AI, data science agents, multimodal models, reinforcement learning, large language models (LLMs), explainability, fairness, privacy, systematic review † † copyright: acmcopyright † † journalyear: 2025 † † doi: XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX † † journal: POMACS † † journalvolume: XX † † journalnumber: X † † article: XXX † † publicationmonth: 5 † † ccs: Agentic AI † † ccs: Data Science Agents 1. Introduction The growing demand for data-driven decision-making across industries has made data science an essential capability (Cao, 2017 ; Sarker, 2021 ) . However, realizing its full potential remains challenging due to steep skill barriers and the inherent complexity of end-to-end analytical workflows. Effective data science requires the seamless integration of expertise in business understanding, statistical analysis, data engineering, modeling, deployment, and visualization (Sarker, 2021 ) , a combination of skills rarely present within a single individual or even across many teams. This persistent expertise gap continues to limit the scalable adoption of data-driven practices, particularly among non-technical users who struggle to navigate the full analytical lifecycle from problem formulation to production deployment. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape of data science by expanding their capabilities far beyond natural language understanding (Yang et al., 2024b ; Yu et al., 2024 ) . LLMs can ingest raw data, generate visualizations, perform statistical analyses, build predictive models, and produce deployment-ready code, all through natural language interactions (Cheng et al., 2023 ; Hassan et al., 2023 ) . These capabilities lower the entry barrier to advanced analytics and enable users without programming or machine learning expertise to engage with complex data science workflows. Leveraging these capabilities, researchers are increasingly developing autonomous agents, widely regarded as a pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. These agents are being applied across diverse domains, including software development (Hong et al., 2023 ) , data science (Zhang et al., 2024b ) , robotics (Kannan et al., 2024 ) , societal simulation (Guo et al., 2024a ) , policy modeling (Qian et al., 2024 ) , gaming (Plaat et al., 2025 ; Wang et al., 2024b ) , scientific discovery (Novikov et al., 2025 ) , and advanced mathematical problem solving at the International Mathematical Olympiad level (Castelvecchi, 2025 ) .

Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges. Finally, since this area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and promising future directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-Based-Modeling-and-Simulation .

Agent-based modeling and simulation focuses on modeling complex systems by simulating individual agents and their interactions within an environment (Macal and North, 2005 ). It operates by assigning specific behaviors, attributes, and decision-making capabilities to these agents, enabling the examination of emergent phenomena resulting from agents’ interactions and environment dynamics. The significance of simulation spans various domains, serving as a valuable tool for understanding, analyzing, and predicting intricate phenomena that might be impractical or impossible to observe directly in real life. It facilitates experimentation, hypothesis testing, and scenario analysis, offering insights into systems’ behaviors under diverse conditions and aiding in decision-making processes across fields like economics, biology, sociology, and ecology. The capacity to acquire and use language is a key aspect that distinguishes humans from other beings (Hauser et al., 2002 ). The advent of large language models (LLMs) represents a recent milestone in machine learning, showcasing immense capabilities in natural language processing tasks and textual generation (Zhao et al., 2023 ). Leveraging their formidable abilities, LLMs have shown promise in enhancing agent-based simulations by enabling more nuanced and realistic representations of agents’ decision-making processes, communication, and adaptation within simulated environments. Integrating LLMs into agent-based modeling and simulation holds the potential to enrich the fidelity and complexity of simulations, potentially yielding deeper insights into system-level behaviors and emergent phenomena for the following reasons: First, LLM agents can take actions even if there are no explicit instructions (Team, 2022 ; Yoheinakajima, 2023 ). Second, LLM agents can respond like a real human with adaptive planning (Schick et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2024b ; Xi et al., 2023 ). Lastly, LLM agents can interact with other agents (or even real humans) (Park et al., 2023 ). Thus, LLM agents have achieved success in a lot of areas (Boiko et al., 2023 ; Bran et al., 2023 ; Gao et al., 2023 ; Jinxin et al., 2023 ; Kovač et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2023c , 2023e ; Lin et al., 2023 ; Park et al., 2023 , 2022 ). From this perspective, it is clear that LLM agents can serve as a new paradigm for simulation with human-level intelligence. As a result of the massive potential of LLM agents, there has recently been a boom in research efforts in this area. However, as yet, there is no survey that systematically summarizes the relevant works, discusses the unresolved issues, and provides a glimpse into important research directions. In this survey, we analyze why large language models are essential in the fundamental problem of simulation, especially for agent-based simulation. After discussing how to design agents in this new paradigm, we carefully and extensively discuss and introduce the existing works in various areas, most of which have been published recently. The contribution of this survey can be summarized as follows. We take the first step to review the existing works of large language model-based agent modeling and simulation. We systematically analyze why large language models can serve as an advanced solution for agent-based modeling and simulation compared with existing approaches. Specifically, we first extensively explain the requirements of the agent capability for agent-based modeling and simulation from four aspects: autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and pro-activeness. Then, we analyze how large language models address these challenges, including perception, reasoning and decision-making, adaptivity, and heterogeneity. We divide the agent-based modeling and simulation into four domains, physical, cyber, social, and hybrid, which can cover the mainstream simulation scenarios and tasks, after which we present the relevant works, providing a detailed discussion about how to design the simulation environment and how to build simulation agents driven by large language models. In addition to the existing works in this new area, we discuss four important research directions, including improving the simulation of scaling up, open simulation platform, robustness, ethical risks, etc., which we believe will inspire future research.

With advancements aimed at making these models smaller, faster, and smarter, coupled with innovative workflows to enhance their accuracy, the future of LLMs looks promising. This article explores the key expectations for LLMs in 2024, focusing on their efficiency, the rise of agentic workflows, larger context size support, and the evolving role of prompt engineers. LLMs Will Get Smaller, Faster, and Smarter The trend towards more efficient and compact models is gaining momentum. Leading AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Microsoft are at the forefront with models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo , Haiku , LLaMA 3 8B , and Phi-3 . Leading AI Models: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Haiku, LLaMA 3 8B, and Phi-3 The research shows that these smaller language models are able to match or even outperform larger and more expensive models like GPT-4 across various benchmarks. For instance, the compact Phi-3-mini model from Microsoft, with only 3.8 billion parameters, is able to rival the performance of models with significantly more parameters like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5. Similarly, the 8 billion parameter LLaMA 3 8B model from Meta has been found to be comparable or even better than the larger GPT-3.5 in certain tasks (Microsoft, 2024) . These advancements in model efficiency are anticipated to further reduce costs, making powerful LLMs more practical and widely available for diverse applications, from customer service chatbots to advanced data analytics. The ability of these smaller and more efficient models to match or exceed the performance of their larger counterparts is a significant development that is expected to democratize access to advanced AI capabilities. Businesses and startups will be able to leverage these cost-effective and energy-efficient LLMs to unlock new use cases and drive innovation. Agentic Workflow One of the most groundbreaking advancements in AI is the shift towards agentic workflows. Andrew Ng , a renowned AI expert, has underscored the significance of these workflows in driving substantial progress. He identifies four key design patterns for AI agentic workflows: Reflection Ability of AI Reflection: LLMs can enhance their effectiveness by reflecting on their own behavior. For example, an LLM used in a customer service application can analyze past interactions to identify patterns in customer queries and improve its responses over time. This self-reflective capability allows the model to learn from its mistakes and adapt to new scenarios, thereby increasing its accuracy and reliability. Tool Use: LLMs can act as agents by utilizing external tools for tasks such as search, code execution, and data manipulation. For instance, an LLM integrated with a financial analysis tool can automatically fetch real-time market data, perform complex calculations, and generate investment recommendations. This ability to leverage external tools extends the functionality of LLMs beyond text generation, making them versatile agents capable of handling a wide range of tasks. Planning: LLMs can autonomously decide on the sequence of steps to execute for complex tasks. Consider an LLM used in project management software. It can break down a project into smaller tasks, assign deadlines, and monitor progress, all while adjusting the plan based on real-time updates. This planning capability enables LLMs to manage intricate workflows efficiently, reducing the need for human intervention. Multi-Agent Collaboration Multi-Agent Collaboration: Prompting an LLM to play different roles for different parts of a complex task can summon a team of AI agents to perform the job more effectively. For example, in a medical diagnosis application, one LLM agent could focus on analyzing patient history, another on interpreting lab results, and a third on suggesting treatment options. By collaborating, these agents can provide a comprehensive diagnosis, improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the system. Ng asserts that these agentic workflows will drive significant AI progress, potentially surpassing the advancements of the next generation of foundation models. This structured and interactive problem-solving process will help improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in LLM implementations. Larger Context Size Support Advancements in context size support are poised to revolutionize the capabilities of LLMs. Models like Google&#x27;s Gemini 1.5 now support context sizes of up to a million tokens, moving towards near-infinite memory capacities. This increased context size will enable more complex, multimodal use cases, such as video analytics and batch data processing. For instance, in video analytics, an LLM with a larger context size can analyze entire video streams rather than just individual frames. This holistic approach allows the model to understand context, detect anomalies, and generate insights more accurately. Similarly, in batch data processing, an LLM can handle large datasets in a single pass, making it possible to perform complex analyses and generate comprehensive reports without the need for multiple iterations. However, it is important to note that these advancements may not be suitable for Q&amp;A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases due to cost and response time impacts. The increased computational requirements for handling larger context sizes can lead to higher operational costs and slower response times, making them less practical for applications that require real-time interactions. Prompt Engineers into Agents Architect With the rise of agentic workflows, the role of prompt engineers is undergoing a transformation. According to Andrew Ng, the future will see prompt engineers transitioning into &quot;Agents Architects.&quot; This new role involves designing how groups of AI agents interact to perform complex tasks effectively.

   └─ Snippets:
      • Agentic RAG innovates the retrieval augmentation concept by broadening it from static, single-turn interactions to the multi-step context of autonomous agents. While RAG focuses on factual grounding, AI Agents provide planning capabilities and adaptability within complex environments. By integrating these two models, agentic RAG seeks to develop autonomous systems that efficiently navigate iterative decision-making tasks without experiencing hallucinations. [...] The retriever module is central to both RAG and Agentic RAG techniques. Two primary methods are traditional sparse vector retrieval (TF-IDF or BM25) and neural dense vector retrieval (incorporating techniques like DPR, ColBERT, or Sentence-BERT). Sparse retrieval methods are well-recognized, straightforward to manage, and perform reliably with short queries. In contrast, neural retrieval often excels in handling more complex queries and synonyms; however, it requires GPU resources for training
      • Agentic RAG is an evolution of the traditional RAG system. While RAG systems combine retrieval with generation, Agentic RAG introduces agents that play a more active role in the process. These agents are intelligent entities that make decisions about which resources to retrieve, how to process the data, and how to generate the response. In Agentic RAG, the agent orchestrates the entire process, enabling more complex, multi-step tasks that require deeper reasoning, tool integration, and informed [...] RAG and Agentic RAG are both key advancements in AI, helping LLMs access and generate relevant, context-aware information. Traditional RAG improves LLMs by connecting them to external data sources, while Agentic RAG goes a step further by adding intelligent agents that handle decisions and complex tasks. If the task is simple and query-based, traditional RAG is enough. However, for more complex, multi-step processes, Agentic RAG offers more flexibility, adaptability, and accuracy. As AI [...] In e-commerce, RAG can be used to generate product descriptions by retrieving relevant product details and specifications.  Agentic RAG can take it a step further by handling complex queries such as recommending products based on user behavior, pricing analysis, and trends from different sources.  ### Challenges with RAG and Agentic RAG  Despite their advantages, both RAG and Agentic RAG face certain challenges:
      • Evaluation: RAG evaluation focuses on retrieval relevance, answer faithfulness to sources, and correctness. Agent evaluation requires trajectory-level assessment: did the agent choose the right actions, recover from failures, and complete the task? Benchmarks like RAGBench: Explainable Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems help for RAG, whereas agent benchmarks are more environment-specific (e.g., WebShop, ALFWorld in ReAct). [...] RAG: relevance, faithfulness, correctness; curate datasets and test suites; incorporate rag evals.     Agents: task success, trajectory quality, safety; configure agent evals across spans and steps. 3. Instrument observability.      RAG: rag tracing, context provenance, re-ranker diagnostics.     Agents: agent tracing, tool outcome logging, error taxonomies, retries. 4. Establish reliability controls. [...] RAG and AI agents are complementary. RAG grounds language models in verifiable knowledge, reducing hallucinations and enabling precise answers to domain-specific queries. AI agents extend this by planning, acting, and coordinating tools to complete goals over multiple steps. To build trustworthy AI, invest in the quality stack—simulations, evals, and observability—and the infrastructure layer—gateways, routing, and governance.

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation has recently attracted attention due to its capacity to ground large language models to external, up-to-date knowledge. In the meantime, AI agents —intelligent software that can perceive and respond to their environment— are essential for tasks involving sequential decision-making, flexibility, and planning. As tasks become more complex, relying solely on one approach (RAG or AI agents) may not be enough. This has resulted in Agentic RAG , which merges RAG’s knowledge capabilities with AI agents’ decision-making skills. This article thoroughly explores RAG, AI agents, and Agentic RAG, emphasizing their theoretical background, foundational principles, and use cases. Prerequisites Before exploring the complexities of AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, it’s important to understand the following foundational elements: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence : Understanding key AI principles like machine learning and natural language processing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation : Insight into how RAG combines retrieval methods with generative models. Autonomous Systems : A fundamental understanding of the importance of autonomy in modern AI applications. Definition and Conceptual Overview of RAG Retrieval-augmented generation merges large language models with retrieval systems, grounding responses in external data instead of relying solely on the training parameters. Traditional LLMs, despite their power, often produce plausible but factually incorrect responses known as hallucinations. Integrating an external retrieval step allows RAG to fetch and add factual or contextual information. An application of the RAG system can be described in the diagram below: Image Source For example, if a user asks a large language model like ChatGPT about a trending news story, the model’s limitations become apparent. It relies on outdated, static information and cannot access real-time updates. RAG addresses this by drawing the latest relevant data from external sources. So, when a user inquires about a news story, RAG fetches the most recent articles or reports related to that question, which are combined with the original query to form a more informative prompt. This augmented prompt enables the language model to generate well-knowledgeable and accurate responses by integrating retrieved knowledge into its output. Consequently, RAG improves the model’s ability to deliver precise and timely information, especially in fields requiring real-time updates, like news, scientific advancements, or financial markets. Key Paradigms of RAG The RAG research model is undergoing important evolution, which can be categorized into three distinct phases: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as illustrated in the image below: Image Source Naive RAG: Initial Methods and Limitations The Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation method represented the initial phase of retrieval-augmented techniques. It uses a straightforward pipeline consisting of: Indexing: Documents are divided into smaller... [truncated]

Report Abuse Kuldeep Paul Posted on Oct 24 RAG vs. AI Agents: What’s the Real Difference and When to Use Each # agents # llm # ai # architecture Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked two powerful paradigms for enterprise AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agents . Both aim to produce useful, trustworthy outputs, yet they solve different classes of problems. If you’re building production-grade AI—chatbots, copilots, voice agents, or autonomous workflows—you need to understand how these approaches differ, how they complement each other, and how to evaluate and monitor them for reliability. This article clarifies the distinction, outlines architectural trade-offs, and shares a practical decision framework for engineering and product teams. It also maps the concepts to capabilities in Maxim AI’s full-stack platform—simulation, evaluation, and observability—so you can ship agentic applications faster with higher quality. What is RAG? Retrieval-Augmented Generation is an architectural pattern that fuses an LLM with external knowledge through retrieval. In the classic formulation, the system indexes a corpus, retrieves the most relevant contexts for a user query, and conditions the generator (LLM) on those contexts to produce a grounded answer. RAG emerged to improve factuality, reduce hallucinations, and make model knowledge updatable without retraining. The seminal work by Lewis et al. showed RAG can outperform parametric-only generation on knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating non-parametric memory. See the original paper in NeurIPS 2020: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks . A typical RAG pipeline includes: Indexing (sparse/dense vectors), candidate retrieval, optional re-ranking, and context assembly. Prompting strategies and document repacking to maximize grounding. Generation conditioned on retrieved evidence and provenance. Because retrieval corpora evolve, RAG evaluation and monitoring require specific metrics (relevance, faithfulness, correctness) and structured datasets. A good overview is the 2024 survey: Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey . For practical guidance, see Maxim AI’s deep dive on metrics and benchmarks: RAG Architecture Analysis: Optimize Retrieval &amp; Generation . What is an AI Agent? An AI agent is an LLM-powered system that actively plans, uses tools, maintains state, and executes goal-oriented actions—often across multiple steps and environments. Unlike a single-turn RAG response, agents interleave reasoning and acting, coordinate tools (APIs, databases, web), and adapt based on observations. The ReAct paradigm formalized this synergy: agents generate reasoning traces and take actions (e.g., search, navigate), improving task success and interpretability across QA and decision-making tasks. See: ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models and the accompanying summary by Google Research: ReAct blog overview . Agents also learn to call external tools via self-supervision, as demonstrated by Toolformer , where language models teach themselves API usage to augment capabilities. See: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools . More recent surveys unify the landscape across single- and multi-agent systems, tools, planning, collaboration, and evaluation challenges; for scope and taxonomy, refer to: Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges and broader agent methodology: Large Language Model Agent: A Survey on Methodology, Applications and Challenges . RAG vs. Agents: The Core Differences While both rely on LLMs, their responsibilities, control flows, and evaluation surfaces differ. Autonomy: RAG answers a query by grounding generation in retrieved context. AI agents pursue goals over multiple steps, planning actions and adapting to feedback from tools and environments. Tooling and Environment: RAG typically interacts with a single knowledge source (vector DB or document store). Agents orchestrate multiple tools—search, databases, code execution, web navigation—and must handle tool errors and state transitions robustly. State and Memory: RAG is often stateless per query beyond the retrieved context. Agents manage task state, working memory, and longer horizons, which introduces complexity in debugging and observability. Evaluation: RAG evaluation focuses on retrieval relevance, answer faithfulness to sources, and correctness. Agent evaluation requires trajectory-level assessment: did the agent choose the right actions, recover from failures, and complete the task? Benchmarks like RAGBench: Explainable Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems help for RAG, whereas agent benchmarks are more environment-specific (e.g., WebShop, ALFWorld in ReAct). Observability and Tracing: RAG observability centers on rag tracing —document candidates, re-ranker decisions, context assembly, prompt variants, and generation outputs. Agent observability requires agent tracing and agent debugging across spans, tool calls, and decision points to diagnose failure modes. Reliability: RAG reliability hinges on retrieval quality and grounding. Agent reliability adds the complexity of tool orchestration, timeouts, rate limits, partial failures, and recovery strategies. In short: RAG is a precision instrument for knowledge grounding; agents are orchestrators for goal-directed, multi-step work. When to Use RAG, When to Use Agents Use RAG when: The core requirement is factual, grounded responses to queries from a known corpus (e.g., policy handbooks, product docs, knowledge bases). Latency, simplicity, and cost control are primary, and multi-step planning is unnecessary. You need robust hall... [truncated]

      • The motivation behind agentic RAG development stems from use cases that require context-aware generation and real-time actions. Examples encompass advanced robotics, legal advisory services, healthcare diagnostics, and ongoing customer service engagements.    In these contexts, merely retrieving relevant information is insufficient. The agent must analyze the information, assess its importance, determine a response, and potentially execute an action in a continuous feedback loop. [...] For example, a robot vacuum cleaner represents a model-based reflex agent. It uses sensors to identify its position and detect obstacles while keeping an internal room map. This map helps the vacuum recall areas it has already cleaned and navigate obstacles more effectively. This way, the agent prevents unnecessary actions and enhances performance compared to a simple reflex system.    Let’s consider the following image:  source
      • #### Real-World Example: IBM Watson Discovery  IBM Watson Discovery is using Agentic RAG to process documents in sectors like healthcare and legal services. They pick out and prioritize important data, point out the main data, and give specific advice.  ##### Impact of AI-powered document processing   Document review is 50% faster.  Accuracy in the identification of key information is enhanced.  Employees get less manual work to do.  ## Conclusion [...] Gartner research points out that well over 92% of respondents are planning to invest in AI-powered tools. These figures reveal that the need for AI technologies like Agentic RAG is steadily increasing to assist in driving efficiency and innovation.  Now, let us check the five most important use cases of the Agentic RAG that can be implemented in large-scale companies:  ### 1. Intelligent Customer Support [...] Unstructured data from emails, documents & databases are stored by large enterprises. Searching for the required information from them always takes a lot of time from the employees. The use of Agentic RAG in the applications improves efficiency through intelligent search capabilities that give the right information in real-time.  #### Real-World Example: Google’s Enterprise Search
      • {{this-blog-only-cta}}  ## Agentic RAG overview  Agentic RAG is when an AI agent uses a RAG pipeline to perform a specific action or set of actions on your behalf.  For example, a traditional RAG pipeline works as follows:  1. A user asks a question (e.g., “Give me the marketing team’s first names and addresses?”). [...] Several 3rd-party solutions already let you implement internal or customer-facing agentic RAG use cases relatively easily.  Here are some examples.  ### Ema’s Employee Assistant AI agent  Ema, a universal AI employee solution, offers an “Employee Assistant AI” agent that lets users make all kinds of requests, such as submitting a vacation request. [...] Your customers’ use cases might require specific agentic RAG implementations.  For example, if an AI agent needs to access data from a 3rd-party system and that system doesn’t support APIs (or at least the relevant endpoints), the AI agent would need to scrape the data from that application.  That said, this situation is likely few and far between.

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation has recently attracted attention due to its capacity to ground large language models to external, up-to-date knowledge. In the meantime, AI agents —intelligent software that can perceive and respond to their environment— are essential for tasks involving sequential decision-making, flexibility, and planning. As tasks become more complex, relying solely on one approach (RAG or AI agents) may not be enough. This has resulted in Agentic RAG , which merges RAG’s knowledge capabilities with AI agents’ decision-making skills. This article thoroughly explores RAG, AI agents, and Agentic RAG, emphasizing their theoretical background, foundational principles, and use cases. Prerequisites Before exploring the complexities of AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, it’s important to understand the following foundational elements: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence : Understanding key AI principles like machine learning and natural language processing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation : Insight into how RAG combines retrieval methods with generative models. Autonomous Systems : A fundamental understanding of the importance of autonomy in modern AI applications. Definition and Conceptual Overview of RAG Retrieval-augmented generation merges large language models with retrieval systems, grounding responses in external data instead of relying solely on the training parameters. Traditional LLMs, despite their power, often produce plausible but factually incorrect responses known as hallucinations. Integrating an external retrieval step allows RAG to fetch and add factual or contextual information. An application of the RAG system can be described in the diagram below: Image Source For example, if a user asks a large language model like ChatGPT about a trending news story, the model’s limitations become apparent. It relies on outdated, static information and cannot access real-time updates. RAG addresses this by drawing the latest relevant data from external sources. So, when a user inquires about a news story, RAG fetches the most recent articles or reports related to that question, which are combined with the original query to form a more informative prompt. This augmented prompt enables the language model to generate well-knowledgeable and accurate responses by integrating retrieved knowledge into its output. Consequently, RAG improves the model’s ability to deliver precise and timely information, especially in fields requiring real-time updates, like news, scientific advancements, or financial markets. Key Paradigms of RAG The RAG research model is undergoing important evolution, which can be categorized into three distinct phases: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as illustrated in the image below: Image Source Naive RAG: Initial Methods and Limitations The Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation method represented the initial phase of retrieval-augmented techniques. It uses a straightforward pipeline consisting of: Indexing: Documents are divided into smaller... [truncated]

      Preview: Top 5 Use Cases of Agentic RAG in Large-Scale Enterprises | Blog Services Industries Portfolio Resources Contact Us Top 5 Use Cases of Agentic RAG in Large-Scale Enterprises Artificial Intelligence Read time: 7 mins Updated: March 24, 2025 Blog Table of contents Loading... Share blog: Artificial Intelligence has become a great asset to companies by streamlining their operations. It also helps in the automation of different functions and helps them with information to make decisions. Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is among the major breakthroughs in AI. It is an AI system that uses both generative and retrieval-based approaches to generate precise, real-time, and context-aware responses. Instead of relying only on predetermined data sets, AI-run Agentic RAG systems can dynamically pull out the most relevant information from external sources. This is the reason why they are a lot stronger in terms of enterprise applications. It is often true that big companies are not able to deal with the huge amount of data, the automation of workflows, and the optimization of decision-making. The way Agentic RAG makes enterprise workflows better is by bridging the gap between static AI models and the necessity for real-time, updated insights. Large-scale enterprises can increase the productivity of their teams with AI being integrated into the existing automation of business processes. This helps to make the customer experience more pleasant, and the decisions are based on data at scale.. The Growth of AI in Large-Scale Enterprises AI adoption in companies is developing at a pace not seen before. According to a recent report from McKinsey , 78% of companies have already implemented automation through AI in their business operations. Gartner research points out that well over 92% of respondents are planning to invest in AI-powered tools. These figures reveal that the need for AI technologies like Agentic RAG is steadily increasing to assist in driving efficiency and innovation. Now, let us check the five most important use cases of the Agentic RAG that can be implemented in large-scale companies: 1. Intelligent Customer Support Enterprises face the big task of dealing with customer queries quickly and effectively. AI chatbots typically have difficulty providing correct answers because their information is usually old. Agentic RAG solves this by getting the most recent data from external databases, FAQs, and product documentation. Real-World Example: Microsoft Copilot Microsoft is now using the AI-powered Agentic RAG solution in their Copilot AI assistant. Copilot does not use any pre-trained responses, instead retrieves the latest available information from Microsoft’s documentation and user forums. This helps to produce more precise and contextually relevant assistance to the customer. Employing Agentic RAG, large-scale enterprises can: Cut response time by 40%. Boost first-time resolution rates. Increase customer satisfaction by offering real-time active information. 2. AI-powered enterprise Search Unstructured data from emails, documents &amp; databases are stored by large enterprises. Searching for the required information from them always takes a lot of time from the employees. The use of Agentic RAG in the applications improves efficiency through intelligent search capabilities that give the right information in real-time. Real-World Example: Google’s Enterprise Search AI has been used by Google to improve the search solutions for large-scale companies. With Agentic RAG, employees can ask questions in the natural language and find their answers from many internal and external sources within a few seconds. The following are the key benefits that Agentic RAG in enterprise search provides: 50% less time is spent on the lookout for the information. Higher productivity of different teams. The search result has become much more precise and with the context easier to understand 3. Automated Compliance &amp; Risk Management One of the main and most important aspects of enterprises, especially those in the finance, healthcare, and legal industries, is regulatory compliance. AI-driven Agentic RAG can aid automated compliance checks by consistently acquiring and analyzing the relevant regulatory content. Real-World Example: JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase has been combining AI-driven automation in enterprises to deal with Enterprise AI challenges and help with compliance. This solution allows the organization to easily track regulatory changes and stay updated with the current regulatory requirements without the need for human supervision. It examines legal papers through AI to find the policy changes and informs the corresponding teams. Agentic RAGs have numerous advantages in compliance automation: 60% reduction in compliance-related manual work. Real-time updates on regulatory changes. Low risk of non-compliance and associated penalties. 4. AI-Powered Intelligence Enterprises need to understand market trends and customer behavior to make decisions. This is possible through Agentic RAG, which can draw data from news sources, financial reports, and social media in real-time to provide important insights for market analysis. Real-World Example: BloombergGPT Agentic RAG has been integrated into its AI-driven market intelligence platform, Bloomberg. The AI fetches real-time financial data, market trends, and expert analysis. The AI assists the users by delivering the most current information regarding their businesses, including investment decisions. Key benefits for large-scale AI implementation strategies: Ability to get timely market information for tactical planning. 30% upgrade of investment decision precision. Rapid action to market fluctuations. 5. Automated Document Processing &amp; Knowledge Management Companies have to deal with a lot of contracts, reports, and research documents. Doing this work manually takes a long time and may become inaccurate. Agentic RAG automates this process through quick and efficient retrieval, summarization, and analysis of the necessary documents. Real-World Example: IBM Watson Discovery IBM Watson Discovery is using Agentic RAG to process documents in sectors like healthcare and legal services. They pick out and prioritize important data, point out the main data, and give specific advice. Impact of AI-powered document processing Document review is 50% faster. Accuracy in the identification of key information is enhanced. Employees get less manual work to do. Conclusion Agentic RAG adoption is undergoing a major shift in how big players are functioning. Whether through AI-powered Agentic RAG customer support or legal and intelligence management automation, this technology improves efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. As AI rapidly keeps evolving, the integration of business process automation with AI will also become way more advanced.

You can ask an AI assistant about your team’s upcoming onsite, for example, and the AI assistant can leverage a document on the onsite in your file storage system to generate an accurate response. Guru&#x27;s enterprise AI search platform can use RAG to generate the output above But what if you also wanted to take an action, like declining or accepting the offsite invitation based on the office it takes place in? That’s where agentic RAG comes in. Read on to learn how agentic RAG works, why it’s becoming increasingly valuable, and how real-world platforms support it. {{this-blog-only-cta}} Agentic RAG overview Agentic RAG is when an AI agent uses a RAG pipeline to perform a specific action or set of actions on your behalf. For example, a traditional RAG pipeline works as follows: 1. A user asks a question (e.g., “Give me the marketing team’s first names and addresses?”). 2. This question gets embedded (or converted into a vector representation) and a large language model (LLM) uses it to search for semantically-similar embeddings in a vector database. 3. The LLM can then use the embeddings it identified as context for generating an output. How a RAG pipeline can work when a user wants to find colleagues in the marketing team Agentic RAG will go a step further: Based on the user’s role and department, the AI agent can offer to take specific actions, like asking marketing for an update on a project that’s relevant to the user or adding these marketing colleagues to an upcoming meeting that requires their support. Agentic RAG can also involve asking an AI agent to take specific actions directly. For instance, a user can ask the AI agent to share all the tickets marked as “Urgent” in a specific Slack channel. This requires the agent to—using RAG—identify these tickets in the project management system before going on to share them in the designated Slack channel. Traditional RAG vs agentic RAG In short, traditional RAG enables users to receive personalized answers to specific questions, while Agentic RAG lets users outsource certain tasks of varying complexity to an AI agent. One isn’t necessarily better than the other. They support fundamentally different needs, and if you can combine the two effectively in your product, you can support a differentiated, cutting-edge solution. Related: How to authenticate to AI agents Benefits of agentic RAG As you can probably tell from our examples, agentic RAG offers several advantages over a traditional RAG workflow. Automates tedious and mundane tasks Agentic RAG lets your employees avoid time consuming and unpleasant work, such as sharing updates with colleagues, setting reminders to perform certain tasks, assigning a ticket to a team member, etc. This frees up your employees and allows them to perform the work they actually enjoy and that’s more impactful for the business. Provides secure data access While it depends on your implementation, you can take measures to ensure the AI agent keeps sensitive data secure and private. For example, the AI agent can request data in 3rd-party systems via their API endpoints to ensure users have the proper permissions to access and interact with the data. Supports complex workflows Agentic RAG doesn’t just support the boring and simple parts of your employees’ jobs. They can also handle multi-step, multi-application processes that rely on business logic. You can even use agentic RAG to determine workflows for specific scenarios. For example, you can set up a workflow where, depending on a ticket’s level of importance, the customer(s) that&#x27;s impacted, and the category it falls under, the AI agent can determine a tailor-made remediation process and go on to execute it. Uses several data sources AI agents can access your internal or customer data in a variety of ways, whether that’s via API endpoints, tools exposed from a Model Content Protocol (MCP) server , flat files downloaded from an application, and so on. Since data access isn’t a blocker for AI agents, they can support a wide range of RAG scenarios . https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-agent-integrations?blog-related=image Examples of agentic RAG Several 3rd-party solutions already let you implement internal or customer-facing agentic RAG use cases relatively easily. Here are some examples. Ema’s Employee Assistant AI agent Ema , a universal AI employee solution, offers an “Employee Assistant AI” agent that lets users make all kinds of requests, such as submitting a vacation request. Once the AI agent receives a vacation request, it&#x27;d retrieve that employee’s vacation balance by making the relevant API request in the customer’s HR software. Assuming the employee has enough days remaining in their PTO balance, the AI agent can make the request directly in the HR software via a separate API request. And once that&#x27;s successful, the agent would send the employee a confirmation message. Related: Model Context Protocol integration examples Peoplelogic’s Team Growth Coordinator AI agent (“Noah”) Peoplelogic , a leader in AI for HR, offers an AI agent, Noah, that can take admin tasks off of recruiters’ plates. For example, a recruiter can ask the AI agent within Slack to share information on candidates with interviewers on the day of their interviews. These messages can include details like the time the interviews are taking place, the roles candidates are interviewing for, summaries on the candidates’ backgrounds, and more. Noah would then retrieve the candidates’ interview schedules, profile information, attachments, and more from the integrated ATSs to generate timely messages for interviewers. Juicebox’s “Juicebox Agents” Juicebox , an AI recruiting platform, offers Juicebox Agents to, among other things, help recruiters identify relevant candidates, quickly. These agents can use job descriptions from the open roles in customers’ integrated ATSs and public sources—professional profiles, websites, published papers, etc.—as context for generating thousands of relevant candidates for given role.

Report Abuse Kuldeep Paul Posted on Oct 24 RAG vs. AI Agents: What’s the Real Difference and When to Use Each # agents # llm # ai # architecture Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked two powerful paradigms for enterprise AI: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI agents . Both aim to produce useful, trustworthy outputs, yet they solve different classes of problems. If you’re building production-grade AI—chatbots, copilots, voice agents, or autonomous workflows—you need to understand how these approaches differ, how they complement each other, and how to evaluate and monitor them for reliability. This article clarifies the distinction, outlines architectural trade-offs, and shares a practical decision framework for engineering and product teams. It also maps the concepts to capabilities in Maxim AI’s full-stack platform—simulation, evaluation, and observability—so you can ship agentic applications faster with higher quality. What is RAG? Retrieval-Augmented Generation is an architectural pattern that fuses an LLM with external knowledge through retrieval. In the classic formulation, the system indexes a corpus, retrieves the most relevant contexts for a user query, and conditions the generator (LLM) on those contexts to produce a grounded answer. RAG emerged to improve factuality, reduce hallucinations, and make model knowledge updatable without retraining. The seminal work by Lewis et al. showed RAG can outperform parametric-only generation on knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating non-parametric memory. See the original paper in NeurIPS 2020: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks . A typical RAG pipeline includes: Indexing (sparse/dense vectors), candidate retrieval, optional re-ranking, and context assembly. Prompting strategies and document repacking to maximize grounding. Generation conditioned on retrieved evidence and provenance. Because retrieval corpora evolve, RAG evaluation and monitoring require specific metrics (relevance, faithfulness, correctness) and structured datasets. A good overview is the 2024 survey: Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey . For practical guidance, see Maxim AI’s deep dive on metrics and benchmarks: RAG Architecture Analysis: Optimize Retrieval &amp; Generation . What is an AI Agent? An AI agent is an LLM-powered system that actively plans, uses tools, maintains state, and executes goal-oriented actions—often across multiple steps and environments. Unlike a single-turn RAG response, agents interleave reasoning and acting, coordinate tools (APIs, databases, web), and adapt based on observations. The ReAct paradigm formalized this synergy: agents generate reasoning traces and take actions (e.g., search, navigate), improving task success and interpretability across QA and decision-making tasks. See: ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models and the accompanying summary by Google Research: ReAct blog overview . Agents also learn to call external tools via self-supervision, as demonstrated by Toolformer , where language models teach themselves API usage to augment capabilities. See: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools . More recent surveys unify the landscape across single- and multi-agent systems, tools, planning, collaboration, and evaluation challenges; for scope and taxonomy, refer to: Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges and broader agent methodology: Large Language Model Agent: A Survey on Methodology, Applications and Challenges . RAG vs. Agents: The Core Differences While both rely on LLMs, their responsibilities, control flows, and evaluation surfaces differ. Autonomy: RAG answers a query by grounding generation in retrieved context. AI agents pursue goals over multiple steps, planning actions and adapting to feedback from tools and environments. Tooling and Environment: RAG typically interacts with a single knowledge source (vector DB or document store). Agents orchestrate multiple tools—search, databases, code execution, web navigation—and must handle tool errors and state transitions robustly. State and Memory: RAG is often stateless per query beyond the retrieved context. Agents manage task state, working memory, and longer horizons, which introduces complexity in debugging and observability. Evaluation: RAG evaluation focuses on retrieval relevance, answer faithfulness to sources, and correctness. Agent evaluation requires trajectory-level assessment: did the agent choose the right actions, recover from failures, and complete the task? Benchmarks like RAGBench: Explainable Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems help for RAG, whereas agent benchmarks are more environment-specific (e.g., WebShop, ALFWorld in ReAct). Observability and Tracing: RAG observability centers on rag tracing —document candidates, re-ranker decisions, context assembly, prompt variants, and generation outputs. Agent observability requires agent tracing and agent debugging across spans, tool calls, and decision points to diagnose failure modes. Reliability: RAG reliability hinges on retrieval quality and grounding. Agent reliability adds the complexity of tool orchestration, timeouts, rate limits, partial failures, and recovery strategies. In short: RAG is a precision instrument for knowledge grounding; agents are orchestrators for goal-directed, multi-step work. When to Use RAG, When to Use Agents Use RAG when: The core requirement is factual, grounded responses to queries from a known corpus (e.g., policy handbooks, product docs, knowledge bases). Latency, simplicity, and cost control are primary, and multi-step planning is unnecessary. You need robust hall... [truncated]

Topic Agentic AI Share Did you know that the AI field is evolving rapidly, introducing various innovative methodologies? One such innovation is RAG, which generates contextually relevant responses by leveraging a rich knowledge base. ‍ Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique that blends data retrieval and natural language generation to produce context-rich responses across various industries. On the other hand, agentic AI represents a leap forward in creating intelligent agents that can operate autonomously. Agentic AI represents the systems that operate autonomously. These agentic AI systems can learn and adapt, making them powerful for intelligent decision-making. They demonstrate exceptional proficiency in strategic decision-making and real-time analysis. While both RAG and agentic AI are significant advancements, they differ in their approaches. RAG enhances language models through data retrieval, while agentic AI focuses on autonomous functioning and intelligent agents. In this blog, let’s understand the key differences between RAG and agentic AI. ‍ Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) What is RAG? Retrieval-augmented generation is an innovative technique that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. By integrating information retrieval with natural language generation, RAG allows generative AI systems to access and incorporate real-time data from various databases and articles into their text generation process. This fusion bridges the gap between static training data and the need for up-to-date, contextually accurate information. ‍ How Does RAG Work? RAG employs a methodical process characterized by multiple critical components. Information Retrieval When a user submits a query, the system first identifies relevant information from an external knowledge base. This is typically achieved using vector embeddings, which transform documents into numerical representations for efficient searching. ‍ Language Model Processing After retrieving the pertinent information, the LLM processes this data alongside its internal knowledge to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response. This process ensures that the findings are accurate and firmly rooted in dependable information. Also Read: Fine Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) In 2024 Here ‍ Advantages Of RAG RAG offers several pivotal benefits: Improved Accuracy And Relevance By leveraging external knowledge, RAG enhances the precision of responses, ensuring they are directly relevant to user queries. ‍ Enhanced Factual Grounding The integration of real-time data helps ground responses in verified information, reducing the likelihood of inaccuracies or &quot;hallucinations&quot; often associated with traditional LLMs. ‍ Ability To Handle Complex Queries RAG&#x27;s access to a broader knowledge base enables it to effectively address intricate questions that require detailed and specific answers. ‍ Limitations Of RAG Despite its advantages, RAG also has some limitations: Dependence On The Knowledge Base Quality RAG&#x27;s effectiveness is profoundly reliant on the quality and comprehensiveness of the external data sources it accesses. Inferior data can produce responses that are misleading or inaccurate. ‍ Lack Of Autonomy And Proactive Behavior Unlike agentic AI, which can operate autonomously, RAG systems do not possess proactive capabilities. They rely on user input to retrieve and generate responses, limiting their ability to initiate actions independently. ‍ Exploring Agentic AI What Is Agentic AI? Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit autonomy, goal-oriented behavior, and the ability to learn and adapt to changing environments. These systems can operate independently, making decisions based on their objectives without requiring constant human oversight. This capability allows agentic AI to navigate complex situations effectively, positioning it as a transformative force in the future of AI. ‍ How Does Agentic AI Work? Agentic AI works through several key mechanisms: Self-Preservation Agentic AI systems are designed to prioritize their operational integrity, allowing them to avoid risks and maintain functionality in dynamic environments. ‍ Goal-Directed Behavior These systems focus on achieving specific objectives. Unlike traditional AI, which may perform tasks without understanding the overarching goals, agentic AI actively seeks to fulfill its defined aims. ‍ Learning And Adaptation Agentic AI continuously learns from its interactions and experiences, adapting its strategies over time to improve performance and decision-making. ‍ Social Intelligence Many agentic AI systems possess social intelligence, enabling them to interact effectively with humans and other intelligent agents, facilitating collaboration and communication. ‍ Advantages Of Agentic AI Agentic AI represents a countless pivotal advancement in artificial intelligence, offering: Proactive Problem-Solving Agentic AI can identify potential issues before they escalate, permitting timely interventions that enhance operational efficiency. ‍ Continuous Learning And Improvement These systems evolve by learning from past experiences, leading to ongoing enhancements in their decision-making processes. ‍ Ability To Handle Dynamic Environments Agentic AI excels in unpredictable settings, adjusting its actions based on real-time data and environmental changes. ‍ Limitations Of Agentic AI Agentic AI also poses challenges that must be addressed, which are as follows: Potential For Unintended Consequences The autonomy of agentic AI can lead to unexpected outcomes if the system misinterprets data or makes erroneous decisions. ‍ Ethical Considerations And Bias The deployment of agentic AI raises ethical concerns regarding bias in decision-making processes. Ensuring fairness and accountability is crucial in mitigating these risks.

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      RAG, AI 에이전트, 그리고 Agent 기반 RAG는 각각의 강점과 약점을 가지고 있습니다.  단순한 정보 검색 및 응답 생성에는 RAG가 적합하며, 복잡한 문제 해결 및 자율적인 작업 수행에는 AI 에이전트가 적합합니다. Agent 기반 RAG는 이 두 가지 접근 방식의 장점을 결합하여 더욱 다양한 사용 사례에 적용될 수 있습니다.  기술의 발전과 함께 Agent 기반 RAG의 활용 범위는 더욱 넓어질 것으로 예상됩니다.  따라서, 특정 요구 사항과 사용 사례를 고려하여 적절한 접근 방식을 선택하는 것이 중요합니다.  향후 연구에서는 각 방식의 성능을 비교 분석하고, 특정 사용 사례에 최적화된 알고리즘을 개발하는 것이 필요합니다.

## 핵심 요약
RAG는 사실에 기반한 응답과 단일 턴 상호작용에 뛰어난 반면, AI 에이전트는 복잡한 환경에서 계획 및 적응성을 제공합니다 [1]. Agent 기반 RAG는 RAG와 AI 에이전트의 기능을 통합하여 정보 사용 및 쿼리 개선에 대한 동적 의사 결정을 가능하게 합니다 [2].

## 주요 발견 사항

*   RAG는 검색된 컨텍스트에 기반하여 응답을 생성하는 데 중점을 둡니다 [1].
*   AI 에이전트는 여러 단계를 거쳐 목표를 추구하고, 도구와 환경으로부터 피드백에 적응하며, 액션을 계획합니다 [1].
*   Agent 기반 RAG는 RAG와 AI 에이전트의 기능을 통합합니다 [2]. 이를 통해 시스템은 검색된 정보를 사용하는 방법과 추론을 사용하여 쿼리를 개선하는 방법을 적극적으로 결정할 수 있습니다 [2].
*   기존 RAG는 쿼리-검색-생성 프로세스를 따르므로 Agent 기반 RAG보다 간단하고 빠르며 저렴합니다 [1].
*   Agent 기반 RAG는 더 깊은 추론과 도구 통합이 필요한 다단계 작업에 적합하며 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 액션에 의해 동기가 부여됩니다 [2].
*   Agent 기반 RAG는 여러 검색 시스템과 깊이 통합되어 있으며, 에이전트는 쿼리의 컨텍스트와 복잡성에 따라 사용할 시스템을 동적으로 선택합니다 [3].

## 상세 분석

RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)와 AI 에이전트 기반 접근 방식은 자연어 처리 (NLP) 분야에서 정보를 활용하고 응답을 생성하는 두 가지 주요 패러다임입니다.  두 방법 모두 장단점이 있으며, 특정 사용 사례에 따라 적절한 선택이 달라집니다.

**RAG (검색 증강 생성)**

RAG는 미리 구축된 지식 베이스(예: 벡터 데이터베이스)에서 관련 정보를 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 기반으로 응답을 생성하는 방식입니다 [1]. RAG는 다음과 같은 특징을 가집니다.

*   **사실 기반 응답:** 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 응답을 생성하므로 비교적 사실에 기반한 답변을 제공합니다 [1].  환각(hallucination) 현상을 줄이는 데 효과적입니다.
*   **단일 턴 상호작용:** 일반적으로 단일 쿼리에 대한 응답을 생성하는 데 적합합니다 [1]. 복잡한 다단계 추론이 필요한 작업에는 한계가 있습니다.
*   **간단하고 효율적:**  쿼리-검색-생성 프로세스를 따르므로 구현 및 실행이 비교적 간단하고 빠릅니다 [1].
*   **지식 업데이트 용이:** 지식 베이스를 업데이트하면 응답에 반영되므로, 최신 정보를 유지하기 용이합니다.

**AI 에이전트**

AI 에이전트는 특정 목표를 달성하기 위해 환경과 상호 작용하는 자율적인 엔티티입니다 [1].  AI 에이전트는 다음과 같은 특징을 가집니다.

*   **계획 및 적응성:**  복잡한 작업을 수행하기 위해 계획을 세우고, 환경으로부터 피드백을 받아 적응할 수 있습니다 [1].
*   **다단계 추론:**  여러 단계를 거쳐 추론하고 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다.
*   **도구 통합:**  다양한 도구(예: API, 데이터베이스)를 활용하여 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다 [1].
*   **자율적인 의사 결정:**  사전 정의된 규칙이나 학습된 모델에 따라 스스로 결정을 내립니다.

**Agent 기반 RAG**

Agent 기반 RAG는 RAG와 AI 에이전트의 장점을 결합한 방식입니다 [2]. 에이전트는 쿼리를 분석하고, 적절한 정보 소스를 선택하고, 검색된 정보를 활용하여 응답을 생성합니다. Agent 기반 RAG는 다음과 같은 특징을 가집니다.

*   **동적 의사 결정:** 에이전트는 쿼리의 컨텍스트와 복잡성에 따라 검색 방법 및 정보 사용 방법을 동적으로 결정합니다 [2].
*   **컨텍스트 인식 응답:**  고객의 문제의 특정 컨텍스트에 맞게 응답을 조정하고, 솔루션을 적극적으로 제안할 수 있습니다 [2].
*   **다양한 사용 사례:**  연구, 요약, 코드 수정 등 비동기 작업에 적합합니다 [3]. 또한, 로봇 공학, 법률 자문, 의료, 고객 서비스 등 실시간 액션이 필요한 사용 사례에도 적용할 수 있습니다 [2].

**언제 어떤 방식을 사용해야 할까요?**

*   **RAG:** 간단한 질문에 대한 답변, 특정 문서에서 정보 추출, 제품 설명 생성 등 비교적 단순하고 사실에 기반한 응답이 필요한 경우에 적합합니다.
*   **AI 에이전트:** 복잡한 문제 해결, 의사 결정 지원, 자동화된 작업 수행 등 다단계 추론과 계획이 필요한 경우에 적합합니다.
*   **Agent 기반 RAG:**  컨텍스트에 맞는 정보 제공, 복잡한 쿼리 처리, 다양한 도구 통합이 필요한 경우에 적합합니다. 특히, IBM Watson Discovery는 Agent 기반 RAG를 활용하여 의료 및 법률 서비스 분야에서 문서 처리 속도와 정확도를 향상시키고 있습니다 [2]. 또한, 금융 분야에서 규정 준수 모니터링 및 위험 분석을 자동화하는 데 활용됩니다 [2].
