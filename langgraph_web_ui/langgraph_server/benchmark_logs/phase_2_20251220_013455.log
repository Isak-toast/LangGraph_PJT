      ## 핵심 요약
      
      RAG는 정보 검색과 LLM을 결합하여 답변을 생성하는 반면, AI 에이전트는 사용자 대신 작업을 수행하고 RAG를 통합할 수 있습니다. 데이터 변경 속도와 필요한 작업 수행 능력에 따라 RAG 또는 AI 에이전트를 선택해야 합니다.
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)는 정보 검색과 대규모 언어 모델을 결합하여 답변을 생성합니다 [1].
      *   RAG는 관련 데이터를 검색하고, 사전 색인된 모델에서 벡터 데이터베이스로 추출하여 프롬프트를 보강합니다 [1].
      *   AI 에이전트는 쿼리 엔진을 사용하여 지속적으로 변경되는 데이터에 액세스할 수 있습니다 [2].
      *   AI 에이전트는 사용자를 대신하여 작업을 수행할 수 있으며 RAG를 통합할 수 있습니다 [4].
      *   미세 조정, RAG 및 AI 에이전트는 각각 다른 시나리오에서 뛰어납니다 [3].
