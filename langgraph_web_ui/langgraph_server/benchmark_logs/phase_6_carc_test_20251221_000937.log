Developers now want tools that can orchestrate multiple agents, manage shared state, and support complex workflows with branching, looping, and retries. Two notable frameworks leading this space are CrewAI and LangGraph. While CrewAI focuses on collaborative agent teams—where each agent has a specific role, goal, and communication strategy—LangGraph provides a graph-based workflow engine designed for building structured, resilient LLM applications. Both aim to simplify multi-agent development but approach the problem from different angles: CrewAI emphasizes team coordination, whereas LangGraph emphasizes stateful, production-ready execution. In this comparison, we’ll break down their core philosophies, features, and use cases to help you decide which framework better fits your AI development needs. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is an open-source, Python-based framework designed for orchestrating autonomous, collaborative AI agents, much like a digital team handling complex tasks. Each agent operates with a defined role, such as researcher, writer, or analyst, and works together within a structured crew to solve problems efficiently. CrewAI combines modularity with performance, offering both high-level simplicity and precise control over how agents interact. Through components like Crews and Flows, it supports dynamic collaboration while giving developers the ability to manage control flows, tasks, and environments with flexibility. Agents in CrewAI are set up with defined roles, goals, tools, and even personality through backstories. This is similar to how a human team organizes itself to divide work and minimize errors. The framework allows agents to work sequentially or in parallel, with coordination that ensures shared context and consistent progress. Built from the ground up without dependencies on other orchestration frameworks, CrewAI is lightweight, fast, and adaptable. It is a strong choice for creating enterprise-ready agent systems that can operate on-premise or in the cloud. Backed by an active developer community and growing educational resources, CrewAI makes it easier for teams to build AI solutions that go beyond single-agent capabilities. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source framework from the creators of LangChain, designed to help developers build advanced AI agents and workflows. Instead of following a fixed, linear sequence of steps, LangGraph organizes tasks into a graph structure. In this setup, each node represents a specific task, and the edges define how those tasks connect and pass information. This approach allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps, giving your AI workflows much more flexibility. One of LangGraph’s key strengths is its ability to handle long-running, stateful agents. These agents can pause, wait for input, and resume exactly where they left off, which is valuable for complex decision-making processes. Developers can also insert human checkpoints into a workflow, allowing for manual review or approval before moving forward. LangGraph is built for reliability in production. It integrates with monitoring and debugging tools like LangSmith, making it easier to trace actions, analyze performance, and understand how an agent reached a particular outcome. It also supports persistent memory, enabling agents to maintain context and learn from past interactions across sessions. By combining graph-based logic with strong state management and observability, LangGraph is well-suited for applications where workflows need to adapt dynamically, run continuously, and manage multiple decision paths. Whether it’s powering a multi-agent system, a virtual assistant with complex reasoning, or a workflow that needs to handle unexpected events gracefully, LangGraph provides the structure and tools to make it happen. CrewAI vs LangGraph : Key Differences CrewAI is purpose-built for orchestrating multiple autonomous agents that work together toward a shared goal. It emphasizes collaboration, with agents assigned distinct roles, goals, and tools to tackle different aspects of a task. Its design makes it easy to coordinate complex projects by dividing responsibilities and ensuring that each agent contributes to the final outcome. CrewAI is particularly effective when you want your agents to operate like a specialized team, working either sequentially or in parallel, with a clear structure guiding their interaction. LangGraph, in contrast, focuses on creating flexible, adaptive workflows for AI agents. It uses a graph-based execution model that allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps in a process. This makes it ideal for scenarios where the path to a solution is not strictly linear and may require adjusting actions based on changing inputs. LangGraph’s explicit state management and support for human checkpoints also make it well-suited for long-running, production-grade applications that demand reliability and transparency. Feature CrewAI LangGraph Focus Multi-agent collaboration Flexible multi-agent workflows Execution model Parallel task execution Graph-based execution State management Shared context with crew Explicit persistent state management Human-in-the-loop Possible with structured crew interactions Built-in checkpoints for human review Best use case Specialized agents working together Complex, dynamic workflows When to Use CrewAI CrewAI is the right choice when your project depends on multiple AI agents working together, each with a clearly defined role and responsibility. If you think of your application as a “digital team,” CrewAI gives you the structure to assign tasks, coordinate workflows, and ensure that every agent’s contribution aligns with the... [truncated]

Developers now want tools that can orchestrate multiple agents, manage shared state, and support complex workflows with branching, looping, and retries. Two notable frameworks leading this space are CrewAI and LangGraph. While CrewAI focuses on collaborative agent teams—where each agent has a specific role, goal, and communication strategy—LangGraph provides a graph-based workflow engine designed for building structured, resilient LLM applications. Both aim to simplify multi-agent development but approach the problem from different angles: CrewAI emphasizes team coordination, whereas LangGraph emphasizes stateful, production-ready execution. In this comparison, we’ll break down their core philosophies, features, and use cases to help you decide which framework better fits your AI development needs. What Is CrewAI? CrewAI is an open-source, Python-based framework designed for orchestrating autonomous, collaborative AI agents, much like a digital team handling complex tasks. Each agent operates with a defined role, such as researcher, writer, or analyst, and works together within a structured crew to solve problems efficiently. CrewAI combines modularity with performance, offering both high-level simplicity and precise control over how agents interact. Through components like Crews and Flows, it supports dynamic collaboration while giving developers the ability to manage control flows, tasks, and environments with flexibility. Agents in CrewAI are set up with defined roles, goals, tools, and even personality through backstories. This is similar to how a human team organizes itself to divide work and minimize errors. The framework allows agents to work sequentially or in parallel, with coordination that ensures shared context and consistent progress. Built from the ground up without dependencies on other orchestration frameworks, CrewAI is lightweight, fast, and adaptable. It is a strong choice for creating enterprise-ready agent systems that can operate on-premise or in the cloud. Backed by an active developer community and growing educational resources, CrewAI makes it easier for teams to build AI solutions that go beyond single-agent capabilities. What Is LangGraph? LangGraph is an open-source framework from the creators of LangChain, designed to help developers build advanced AI agents and workflows. Instead of following a fixed, linear sequence of steps, LangGraph organizes tasks into a graph structure. In this setup, each node represents a specific task, and the edges define how those tasks connect and pass information. This approach allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps, giving your AI workflows much more flexibility. One of LangGraph’s key strengths is its ability to handle long-running, stateful agents. These agents can pause, wait for input, and resume exactly where they left off, which is valuable for complex decision-making processes. Developers can also insert human checkpoints into a workflow, allowing for manual review or approval before moving forward. LangGraph is built for reliability in production. It integrates with monitoring and debugging tools like LangSmith, making it easier to trace actions, analyze performance, and understand how an agent reached a particular outcome. It also supports persistent memory, enabling agents to maintain context and learn from past interactions across sessions. By combining graph-based logic with strong state management and observability, LangGraph is well-suited for applications where workflows need to adapt dynamically, run continuously, and manage multiple decision paths. Whether it’s powering a multi-agent system, a virtual assistant with complex reasoning, or a workflow that needs to handle unexpected events gracefully, LangGraph provides the structure and tools to make it happen. CrewAI vs LangGraph : Key Differences CrewAI is purpose-built for orchestrating multiple autonomous agents that work together toward a shared goal. It emphasizes collaboration, with agents assigned distinct roles, goals, and tools to tackle different aspects of a task. Its design makes it easy to coordinate complex projects by dividing responsibilities and ensuring that each agent contributes to the final outcome. CrewAI is particularly effective when you want your agents to operate like a specialized team, working either sequentially or in parallel, with a clear structure guiding their interaction. LangGraph, in contrast, focuses on creating flexible, adaptive workflows for AI agents. It uses a graph-based execution model that allows for branching, looping, and revisiting earlier steps in a process. This makes it ideal for scenarios where the path to a solution is not strictly linear and may require adjusting actions based on changing inputs. LangGraph’s explicit state management and support for human checkpoints also make it well-suited for long-running, production-grade applications that demand reliability and transparency. Feature CrewAI LangGraph Focus Multi-agent collaboration Flexible multi-agent workflows Execution model Parallel task execution Graph-based execution State management Shared context with crew Explicit persistent state management Human-in-the-loop Possible with structured crew interactions Built-in checkpoints for human review Best use case Specialized agents working together Complex, dynamic workflows When to Use CrewAI CrewAI is the right choice when your project depends on multiple AI agents working together, each with a clearly defined role and responsibility. If you think of your application as a “digital team,” CrewAI gives you the structure to assign tasks, coordinate workflows, and ensure that every agent’s contribution aligns with the... [truncated]

Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs, they have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically. Recently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or decision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable progress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the community with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to offer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems based on LLMs, as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to gain substantial insights on the following questions: What domains and environments do LLM-based multi-agents simulate? How are these agents profiled and how do they communicate? What mechanisms contribute to the growth of agents&#39; capacities? For those interested in delving into this field of study, we also summarize the commonly used datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient access. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a professional exploring AI, or someone curious about how these systems work, this guide will provide valuable insights into the ever-expanding world of LLM Agents. What are LLM Agents? LLM Agents are advanced AI systems that leverage large language models to autonomously perform tasks by interpreting inputs, planning actions, and executing them using integrated tools. Unlike traditional chatbots, which are limited to predefined responses, LLM Agents can exhibit complex reasoning, maintain memory of past interactions, and adapt their behavior based on environmental feedback. This enables them to handle intricate tasks across various domains, from automating workflows to providing personalized assistance Different Types of LLM Agents In 2024, Large Language Model (LLM) agents have diversified into specialized categories, each tailored to specific functionalities and applications. Here's an overview of the different types of LLM agents: 1. Conversational Agents These agents engage in natural dialogue with users, providing information, answering questions, and assisting with various tasks. They rely on LLMs to understand and generate human-like responses. Example : Customer support chatbots that handle inquiries and provide solutions. 2. Task-Oriented Agents Focused on performing specific tasks or achieving predefined objectives, these agents interact with users to understand their needs and then execute actions to fulfill those needs. Example : AI assistants that schedule appointments or manage emails. 3. Creative Agents Capable of generating original and creative content such as artwork, music, or writing, these agents use LLMs to understand human preferences and artistic styles, enabling them to produce content that resonates with audiences. Example : Content generation tools that draft articles or create digital art. 4. Collaborative Agents These agents work alongside humans to accomplish shared goals or tasks, facilitating communication, coordination, and cooperation between team members or between humans and machines. LLMs may support collaborative agents by assisting in decision-making, generating reports, or providing insights. Example: Project management bots that help teams coordinate tasks and deadlines. 5. Multimodal Agents Extending beyond text, multimodal agents process and generate content across various formats, including audio, images, and video. This capability allows for richer and more immersive interactions. Example: Virtual assistants that can interpret visual data or generate images based on textual descriptions. 6. Autonomous Agents Designed to operate with minimal human intervention, autonomous agents can make decisions and perform actions independently. They are often used in environments where continuous operation is essential. Example: Robotic process automation bots that handle repetitive tasks in business processes. 7. Multi-Agent Systems Involving multiple LLM agents working collaboratively, these systems tackle complex tasks by leveraging the strengths of various specialized agents. They communicate and coordinate to achieve common objectives. Example: A team of agents where one gathers data, another analyzes it, and a third generates reports based on the analysis.

By LangChain 6 min read Dec 19, 2024 Another year of building with LLMs is coming to an end —&nbsp;and 2024 didn’t disappoint. With nearly 30k users signing up for LangSmith every month, we’re lucky to have front row seats to what’s happening in the industry.&nbsp; As we did last year , we want to share some product usage patterns that showcase how the AI&nbsp;ecosystem and practice of building LLM apps are evolving. As folks have traced, evaluated, and iterated their way around LangSmith, we’ve seen a few notable changes. These include the dramatic rise of open-source model adoption and a shift from predominantly retrieval workflows to AI agent applications with multi-step, agentic workflows.&nbsp; Dive into the stats below to learn exactly what developers are building, testing, and prioritizing. Infrastructure usage With Large Language Models (LLMs) eating the world, everyone’s asking the mirror-mirror-on-the-wall question: “Which model is the most utilized of them all?” Let’s unpack what we’ve seen. Top LLM providers Like last year’s results , OpenAI reigns as the most used LLM provider among LangSmith users —&nbsp;used more than 6x as much as Ollama, the next-most popular provider (counted by LangSmith organization usage). Interestingly, Ollama and Groq (which both allow users to run open source models, with the former focusing on local execution and the latter on cloud deployment) have accelerated in momentum this year, breaking into the top 5. This shows a growing interest in more flexible deployment options and customizable AI infrastructure. When it comes to providers that offer open-source models, the top providers have stayed relatively consistent compared to last year - Ollama, Mistral, and Hugging Face have made it easy for developers to run open source models on their platforms. These OSS providers’ collective usage represents 20% of the top 20 LLM providers (by the number of organizations using them).&nbsp; Top Retrievers / Vector Stores Performing retrieval is still critical for many GenAI workflows. The top 3 vector stores have remained the same as last year, with Chroma and FAISS as the most popular choices. This year, Milvus, MongoDB, and Elastic’s vector databases have also entered the top 10.&nbsp; Building with LangChain products As developers have gained more experience utilizing generative AI, they are also building more dynamic applications. From the growing sophistication of workflows, to the rise of AI agents — we’re seeing a few trends that point to an evolving ecosystem of innovation. Observability isn’t limited to LangChain applications While langchain (our open source framework) is central to many folks’ LLM app development journeys, 15.7% of LangSmith traces this year come from non- langchain frameworks. This reflects a broader trend where observability is needed regardless of what framework you’re using to build the LLM app — and that interoperability is supported by LangSmith. Python remains dominant, while JavaScript usage grows Debugging, testing, and monitoring certainly has a special place in our Python developers’ hearts, with 84.7% usage coming from the Python SDK. But there is a notable and growing interest in JavaScript as developers pursue web-first applications —&nbsp;the JavaScript SDK accounts for 15.3% of LangSmith usage this year, increasing 3x compared to the previous year.&nbsp; AI agents are gaining traction As companies are getting more serious about incorporating AI agents across various industries , adoption of our controllable agent framework, LangGraph, is also on the rise. Since its release in March 2024, LangGraph has steadily gained traction —&nbsp;with 43% of LangSmith organizations are now sending LangGraph traces . These traces represent complex, orchestrated tasks that go beyond basic LLM interactions. This growth aligns with the rise in agentic behavior: we see that on average 21.9% of traces now involve tool calls, up from an average of 0.5% in 2023. Tool calling allows a model to autonomously invoke functions or external resources, signaling more agentic behavior where the model decides when to take action. Increased use of tool calling can enhance an agent’s ability to interact with external systems and perform tasks like writing to databases.&nbsp; Performance and optimization Balancing speed and sophistication is a key challenge when developing applications — especially those leveraging LLM resources. Below, we explore how organizations are interacting with their applications to align the complexity of their needs with efficient performance. Complexity is growing, but tasks are being handled efficiently&nbsp;&nbsp; The average number of steps per trace has more than doubled over the past year, rising from on average 2.8 steps (2023) to 7.7 steps (2024). We define a step as a distinct operation within a trace, such as a call to an LLM, retriever, or tool. This growth in steps signals that organizations are leveraging more complex and multi-faceted workflows. Rather than a simple question-answer interaction, users are building systems that chain together multiple tasks, such as retrieving information, processing it, and generating actionable results. In contrast, the average number of LLM calls per trace has grown more modestly— from on average 1.1 to 1.4 LLM calls. This speaks to how developers are designing systems to achieve more with fewer LLM calls, balancing functionality while keeping expensive LLM requests in check LLM testing &amp; evaluation What are organizations doing to test their LLM applications to guard against inaccurate or low-quality LLM-generated responses? While it’s no easy feat to keep the quality of your LLM app high , we see organizations using LangSmith’s evaluation capabilities to automate testing and generate user feedback loops to create more robust, reliable applications. LLM-as-Judge: Evaluating what matters LLM-as-Judge evaluators capture grading rules into an LLM prompt and use the LLM to score whether the output adheres to specific criteria. We see developers testing for these characteristics the most: Relevance , Correctness , Exact Match , and Helpfulness These highlight that most developers are doing coarse checks for response quality to make sure AI generated outputs don’t completely miss the mark.&nbsp; Iterating with human feedback&nbsp; Human feedback is a key part of the iteration loop for folks building LLM apps. LangSmith speeds up the process of collecting and incorporating human feedback on traces and runs (i.e. spans) – so that users can create rich datasets for improvement and optimization. Over the past year, annotated runs grew 18x , scaling linearly with growth in LangSmith usage. Feedback volume per run also increased slightly, rising from 2.28 to 2.59 feedback entries per run . Still, feedback is relatively sparse per run. Users may be prioritizing speed in reviewing runs over providing comprehensive feedback, or commenting on only the most critical or problematic runs that need attention.&nbsp; Conclusion In 2024, developers leaned into complexity with multi-step agents, sharpened efficiency by doing more with fewer LLM calls, and added quality checks to their apps using methods of feedback and evaluation. As more LLM apps are created, we’re excited to see how folks dig into smarter workflows, better performance, and stronger reliability.&nbsp; Learn more here about how LangSmith can bring more visibility into your LLM app development and improve performance over time —&nbsp;from debugging bottlenecks to evaluating response quality to monitoring regressions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tags By LangChain Join our newsletter Updates from the LangChain team and community ...

      • This time last year, I wrote that AI engineering in 2023 was defined by a proliferation of LLMs and an expansion of AI dev tooling. In 2024, those trends continued — but also the market for both LLMs and AI development tools matured considerably. This year, AI got integrated into the core tools of developers (IDEs), while new techniques for creating “AI agents” arose in secondary tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. The types of LLMs available also became more varied, with smaller models and [...] Let’s take a deeper look at five key AI engineering trends that emerged this year.  ## 1. Agentic Systems  If “prompting” was the word of the year in AI development last year, then “agentic” was this year’s buzzy word. An AI agent is an automated piece of software that uses large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, and this year everyone was building an agent and/or an “agentic system.” [...] Meanwhile, in a separate presentation at the World’s Fair, LlamaIndex creator Jerry Liu pitched agents as the natural successor to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the most common method of integrating a pretrained LLM with an external data source. LlamaIndex calls its AI agents “knowledge assistants,” perhaps to make them more enterprise-friendly.

Share on X Icon to share article on WhatsApp. Share on WhatsApp Copy link Introduction As we step into 2024, the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is set to redefine the AI landscape. With advancements aimed at making these models smaller, faster, and smarter, coupled with innovative workflows to enhance their accuracy, the future of LLMs looks promising. This article explores the key expectations for LLMs in 2024, focusing on their efficiency, the rise of agentic workflows, larger context size support, and the evolving role of prompt engineers. LLMs Will Get Smaller, Faster, and Smarter The trend towards more efficient and compact models is gaining momentum. Leading AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Microsoft are at the forefront with models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo , Haiku , LLaMA 3 8B , and Phi-3 . Leading AI Models: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Haiku, LLaMA 3 8B, and Phi-3 The research shows that these smaller language models are able to match or even outperform larger and more expensive models like GPT-4 across various benchmarks. For instance, the compact Phi-3-mini model from Microsoft, with only 3.8 billion parameters, is able to rival the performance of models with significantly more parameters like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5. Similarly, the 8 billion parameter LLaMA 3 8B model from Meta has been found to be comparable or even better than the larger GPT-3.5 in certain tasks (Microsoft, 2024) . These advancements in model efficiency are anticipated to further reduce costs, making powerful LLMs more practical and widely available for diverse applications, from customer service chatbots to advanced data analytics. The ability of these smaller and more efficient models to match or exceed the performance of their larger counterparts is a significant development that is expected to democratize access to advanced AI capabilities. Businesses and startups will be able to leverage these cost-effective and energy-efficient LLMs to unlock new use cases and drive innovation. Agentic Workflow One of the most groundbreaking advancements in AI is the shift towards agentic workflows. Andrew Ng , a renowned AI expert, has underscored the significance of these workflows in driving substantial progress. He identifies four key design patterns for AI agentic workflows: Reflection Ability of AI Reflection: LLMs can enhance their effectiveness by reflecting on their own behavior. For example, an LLM used in a customer service application can analyze past interactions to identify patterns in customer queries and improve its responses over time. This self-reflective capability allows the model to learn from its mistakes and adapt to new scenarios, thereby increasing its accuracy and reliability. Tool Use: LLMs can act as agents by utilizing external tools for tasks such as search, code execution, and data manipulation. For instance, an LLM integrated with a financial analysis tool can automatically fetch real-time market data, perform complex calculations, and generate investment recommendations. This ability to leverage external tools extends the functionality of LLMs beyond text generation, making them versatile agents capable of handling a wide range of tasks. Planning: LLMs can autonomously decide on the sequence of steps to execute for complex tasks. Consider an LLM used in project management software. It can break down a project into smaller tasks, assign deadlines, and monitor progress, all while adjusting the plan based on real-time updates. This planning capability enables LLMs to manage intricate workflows efficiently, reducing the need for human intervention. Multi-Agent Collaboration Multi-Agent Collaboration: Prompting an LLM to play different roles for different parts of a complex task can summon a team of AI agents to perform the job more effectively. For example, in a medical diagnosis application, one LLM agent could focus on analyzing patient history, another on interpreting lab results, and a third on suggesting treatment options. By collaborating, these agents can provide a comprehensive diagnosis, improving the overall accuracy and reliability of the system. Ng asserts that these agentic workflows will drive significant AI progress, potentially surpassing the advancements of the next generation of foundation models. This structured and interactive problem-solving process will help improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in LLM implementations. Larger Context Size Support Advancements in context size support are poised to revolutionize the capabilities of LLMs. Models like Google&#x27;s Gemini 1.5 now support context sizes of up to a million tokens, moving towards near-infinite memory capacities. This increased context size will enable more complex, multimodal use cases, such as video analytics and batch data processing. For instance, in video analytics, an LLM with a larger context size can analyze entire video streams rather than just individual frames. This holistic approach allows the model to understand context, detect anomalies, and generate insights more accurately. Similarly, in batch data processing, an LLM can handle large datasets in a single pass, making it possible to perform complex analyses and generate comprehensive reports without the need for multiple iterations. However, it is important to note that these advancements may not be suitable for Q&amp;A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases due to cost and response time impacts. The increased computational requirements for handling larger context sizes can lead to higher operational costs and slower response times, making them less practical for applications that require real-time interactions. Prompt Engineers into Agents Architect With the rise of agentic workflows, the role of prompt engineers is undergoing a transformation. According to Andrew Ng, the future will see prompt engineers transitioning into &quot;Agents Architects.&quot; This new role involves designing how groups of AI agents interact to perform complex tasks effectively.

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      2024년 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템 연구는 LLM이 역할, 환경, 기억을 통합하여 에이전트로 진화하고 있으며, 멀티 에이전트 시스템을 통해 다양한 영역을 시뮬레이션하고, 궁극적으로 인간 역량 강화 및 자동화 애플리케이션에 활용되는 추세를 보여준다 [14, 2, 6, 7]. 또한 에이전트의 효율성, 품질, 다국어 지원 강화에 대한 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있다 [8, 9, 17].
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   LLM은 역할, 환경, 메모리 등의 요소를 통합하여 에이전트로 변모하고 있으며 [1, 14], 이를 통해 다양한 영역에서의 시뮬레이션이 가능해진다 [2, 14].
      *   LLM 기반 멀티 에이전트 시스템은 다양한 도메인과 환경 시뮬레이션에 활용된다 [2, 14].  LLM 기반 멀티 에이전트의 발전과 과제를 다루는 서베이 논문(arXiv:2402.01680)이 발표되었다 [3, 12, 15, 6].
      *   LLM 에이전트는 고객 지원, 마케팅, 워크플로우 자동화 등 다양한 분야에서 인간 역량 강화를 위해 활용되며 [7, 18], 일상생활의 파트너로 진화하고 있다 [6].

      ## 상세 분석
      
      ### LLM 에이전트의 진화 및 변환
      
      LLM은 단순한 언어 모델을 넘어, 특정 역할을 수행하고, 주어진 환경과 상호작용하며, 과거의 경험(메모리)을 활용하여 의사 결정을 내리는 에이전트로서 진화하고 있다 [1, 14]. 이러한 변화는 LLM이 특정 목표를 달성하기 위해 필요한 일련의 행동을 자율적으로 계획하고 실행할 수 있게 함으로써, 기존의 단순 질의 응답 시스템과는 차별화되는 지능형 시스템 구축의 가능성을 열어준다. 특히, 다양한 도메인 시뮬레이션에 LLM 에이전트를 활용함으로써 복잡한 시스템의 동작을 예측하고 최적화하는 데 기여할 수 있다 [2, 14].
      
      ### 멀티 에이전트 시스템의 활용
      
      LLM 기반 멀티 에이전트 시스템은 각각의 LLM 에이전트가 서로 협력하거나 경쟁하면서 특정 목표를 달성하는 시스템을 의미한다. 이는 사회 시뮬레이션, 경제 모델링, 분산 시스템 제어 등 다양한 분야에 적용될 수 있으며, 복잡한 문제 해결에 효과적인 접근 방식을 제공한다 [2, 14]. arXiv:2402.01680 서베이 논문은 LLM 기반 멀티 에이전트 시스템의 현재 발전 상황과 해결해야 할 과제를 심층적으로 분석하고 있으며 [3, 12, 15, 6], 향후 연구 방향을 제시하고 있다.

They continuously re-evaluate information retrieval strategies. This agentic process enhances adaptability and performance. Agency and Autonomy Agency and autonomy define the agentic RAG approach. Autonomous AI agents in agentic RAG decide which information to search and how to process it. They adjust prompts dynamically based on goals and context. This agentic capability allows for real-time adaptability. Agentic RAG employs autonomous AI agents for dynamic decision-making. It enhances contextual understanding and adapts to changing user needs. Traditional RAG systems follow static workflows and lack the ability to refine responses. Agentic RAG continuously analyzes context and user intent, allowing for dynamic data retrieval. The key differences between traditional RAG and agentic RAG highlight the importance of agency, workflow flexibility, and adaptability. Agentic RAG leverages autonomous AI agents to deliver advanced reasoning and dynamic problem-solving. Traditional RAG provides reliable results for simple, static tasks but cannot match the agentic approach in complex scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Explained Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation. This approach allows AI systems to fetch relevant data from external sources and generate coherent responses. The core features of RAG include a retrieval module and a generation module. These modules work together to improve the accuracy and relevance of ai outputs. Traditional RAG Features Traditional rag uses a straightforward workflow. The retrieval module identifies and fetches documents from a knowledge base using vector search and keyword matching. The generation module then combines this data with the original query to create a response. The augmentation step integrates retrieved information through document concatenation and embedding-based integration. The generation phase processes the augmented input using transformer architectures. Core Component Description Retrieval Module Identifies and fetches relevant documents from external sources based on a given query. Generation Module Combines retrieved data with the original input to synthesize a coherent response. Retrieval Process Involves searching through a knowledge base using vector search and keyword matching. Augmentation Step Integrates retrieved information with the original query through document concatenation and embedding-based integration. Generation Phase Processes the augmented input using transformer architectures and fine-tuning strategies for coherent responses. Traditional rag handles queries in a single pass. It relies on fixed retrieval strategies and limited context windows. Multi-step reasoning requires extra classifiers and models. In practical applications, AI teams use metrics like MRR, nDCG, Precision, Recall, and F1 to evaluate performance. For customer support, AI measures resolution rate and customer satisfaction. For sales enablement, ai tracks deal acceleration and content utilization. Agentic RAG Features Agentic rag introduces autonomy and adaptability. Autonomous AI agents identify missing elements and seek out information for task completion. They use dynamic information retrieval to access real-time data. Augmented generation integrates external information into contextually relevant responses. A feedback loop refines outputs based on user feedback, enabling continuous improvement. Autonomy: Agents identify and seek out missing elements for task completion. Dynamic Retrieval: Agents access real-time data for accurate outputs. Augmented Generation: Agents integrate external information into coherent responses. Feedback Loop: Agents refine responses based on feedback for continuous improvement. Agentic rag breaks queries into sub-queries and adapts retrieval strategies based on context. It excels at multi-step reasoning across documents. The system interacts with tools and databases without needing extra classifiers. Agentic rag demonstrates scalability by adjusting task granularity and scheduling tasks dynamically. Ai systems using agentic rag show enhanced responsiveness and robustness, even in complex environments.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows AI agents to access dynamic knowledge by retrieving information from constantly changing data sources, improving accuracy and decision-making. NVIDIA provides tools and infrastructure, including the NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint, NeMo Retriever, and NeMo Agent Toolkit, to accelerate the development of RAG-powered AI agents and AI query engines. AI-generated content may summarize information incompletely. Verify important information. Learn more Ever relied on an old GPS that didn’t know about the new highway bypass, or a sudden road closure? It might get you to your destination, but not in the most efficient or accurate way.&nbsp; AI agents face a similar challenge: they often rely on static training data. This data is fixed at a point in time—while it was current when created, it can quickly become outdated. This limitation can cause problems in real-world use: Hallucinations: Agents might generate incorrect facts that sound believable. Stale Information: They can&#8217;t access the newest data or real-time updates. Knowledge Gaps: They may lack specific, private, or emerging information. Security: Data permissions may change over time, or previously available data can become confidential. Now, imagine a GPS that updates in real time, instantly knowing about every new road, every traffic jam, and every shortcut. That’s the power of dynamic knowledge for AI agents, and it’s revolutionizing how AI can respond to our ever-changing world. AI agents need access to dynamic knowledge Beyond simple chatbots, AI agents are sophisticated AI systems designed to operate on their own. As NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang described , AI agents are &#8220;information robots&#8221; that &#8220;perceive, reason, plan, and act.&#8221; They are built to understand problems, make plans, use various tools, and even understand different types of information, like text and images. An AI agent’s core capabilities include: Perceiving: Understanding their surroundings and the context of a situation. Reasoning: Breaking down complex problems and strategizing solutions. Planning: Creating step-by-step actions to achieve their goals. Acting: Executing tasks, often by using various digital tools. From searching internal company documents to external databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows an AI agent to find and use dynamic knowledgeーdata that is constantly changing. Using an AI query engine , you can give your agents access to constantly changing data, both internal and external, and use reasoning to enhance agent accuracy and decision-making, helping them perform complex tasks reliably. What&#8217;s the difference between RAG and agentic RAG? RAG is a technique where an AI model retrieves information from a knowledge base before generating its response. This retrieval augments the generation process. Traditional RAG is like a quick lookup. The AI queries a knowledge base, retrieves information, and then generates a response. Agentic RAG is more dynamic. Here, the AI agent actively manages how it gets information, integrating RAG into its reasoning process. It’s not just retrieving; it’s refining its queries using reasoning, turning RAG into a sophisticated tool, and managing information over time. This intelligent approach allows AI agents to adapt much better to changing situations.&nbsp; Key Differences: Traditional RAG: Simple &#8211; query, retrieve, generate. Typically faster and less expensive. Agentic RAG: Dynamic &#8211; agent queries, refines, uses RAG as a tool, manages context over time. Works well for asynchronous tasks including research, summarization, and code correction. How query engines enable continuous learning for AI agents At the heart of this dynamic knowledge system are AI query engines. These aren’t just basic search tools—they’re powerful systems that connect AI agents to massive, diverse, and constantly updated data sources. They act as a critical bridge between an agent&#8217;s need for information and an organization&#8217;s extensive, dynamic knowledge base distributed across the organization. AI query engines can: Handle Huge Amounts of Data: Ingests and organizes vast quantities of information from both private and public sources, including text, images, video, and structured data, and built to handle continuous updates. Retrieve Accurately: Using advanced techniques like multimodal embeddings, vector search, and reranking to find the most current and relevant knowledge. Enable Continuous Learning: Supporting feedback loops where the AI agent’s actions or insights can update the knowledge base, creating a cycle of continuous improvement. Understanding: They help agents interpret unclear natural language queries to find relevant information across different data types. AI query engines are central to RAG. They ensure AI agents always access the freshest, most relevant information for complex decision-making, leading to improved real-time accuracy. Designing an agentic RAG system with reasoning This process combines the AI agent&#8217;s reasoning with the AI query engine&#8217;s data access. The agentic RAG workflow is: Agent Needs Data: An AI agent identifies a task requiring current information (e.g., a real-time market analysis). Query Generation: The agent creates a specific query and sends it to the AI query engine. Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval: The AI query engine searches its constantly updated knowledge base. It extracts relevant information (text, images, audio, structured data) and prioritizes it to provide the most relevant information. Context Augmentation: This retrieved, current information is added to the agent&#8217;s current prompt. This creates a richer context for the LLM. Enhanced Decision and Action: The LLM, with this new, up-to-date context, provides a more accurate response, forms a better plan, or makes a more informed decision. What are the benefits of RAG for AI agents? RAG and powerful AI query engines significantly improve AI agent&#8217;s capabilities, especially when dealing with dynamic information. Improved Accuracy: Agents provide reliable information because their responses are based on verified, current data. Accuracy is also improved because it’s not just a one-shot query—an agent can use a reasoning model to check the relevancy of an answer, and rewrite the query, iterating until the best response is achieved. Real-time Relevance: Access to the very latest information means agents operate with up-to-date knowledge. Enhanced Contextual Understanding: A deeper grasp of queries leads to more precise and useful responses. Greater Adaptability: Agents can adjust strategies on the fly based on new, real-time data, making them more flexible. Reduced Hallucinations: Using external, verifiable data reduces the chance of generating incorrect or made-up information. Scalable Knowledge: Agents can tap into vast, diverse, and constantly updated data sources, expanding their operational scope. Multimodality: Uncover insights hidden in graphics, charts, and images using RAG to extract information. Enhanced Security: Using RAG to pull data from private, curated sources where access permissions can be centrally managed. Fueling the AI agent development ecosystem NVIDIA provides accelerated infrastructure and software tools to accelerate RAG-powered AI agents and their underlying AI query engines.

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation has recently attracted attention due to its capacity to ground large language models to external, up-to-date knowledge. In the meantime, AI agents —intelligent software that can perceive and respond to their environment— are essential for tasks involving sequential decision-making, flexibility, and planning. As tasks become more complex, relying solely on one approach (RAG or AI agents) may not be enough. This has resulted in Agentic RAG , which merges RAG’s knowledge capabilities with AI agents’ decision-making skills. This article thoroughly explores RAG, AI agents, and Agentic RAG, emphasizing their theoretical background, foundational principles, and use cases. Prerequisites Before exploring the complexities of AI Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, it’s important to understand the following foundational elements: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence : Understanding key AI principles like machine learning and natural language processing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation : Insight into how RAG combines retrieval methods with generative models. Autonomous Systems : A fundamental understanding of the importance of autonomy in modern AI applications. Definition and Conceptual Overview of RAG Retrieval-augmented generation merges large language models with retrieval systems, grounding responses in external data instead of relying solely on the training parameters. Traditional LLMs, despite their power, often produce plausible but factually incorrect responses known as hallucinations. Integrating an external retrieval step allows RAG to fetch and add factual or contextual information. An application of the RAG system can be described in the diagram below: Image Source For example, if a user asks a large language model like ChatGPT about a trending news story, the model’s limitations become apparent. It relies on outdated, static information and cannot access real-time updates. RAG addresses this by drawing the latest relevant data from external sources. So, when a user inquires about a news story, RAG fetches the most recent articles or reports related to that question, which are combined with the original query to form a more informative prompt. This augmented prompt enables the language model to generate well-knowledgeable and accurate responses by integrating retrieved knowledge into its output. Consequently, RAG improves the model’s ability to deliver precise and timely information, especially in fields requiring real-time updates, like news, scientific advancements, or financial markets. Key Paradigms of RAG The RAG research model is undergoing important evolution, which can be categorized into three distinct phases: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as illustrated in the image below: Image Source Naive RAG: Initial Methods and Limitations The Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation method represented the initial phase of retrieval-augmented techniques. It uses a straightforward pipeline consisting of: Indexing: Documents are divided into smaller... [truncated]

      ## 상세 분석
      
      **RAG (검색 증강 생성)**
      
      RAG는 외부 지식 소스에서 정보를 검색하여 언어 모델의 응답을 향상시키는 기술입니다. 기존의 RAG 방식은 미리 정의된 질문을 사용하여 정보를 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 답변을 생성하는 정적인 프로세스를 따릅니다. 따라서, 간단하고 명확한 질의 응답 작업에 적합합니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 특정 제품에 대한 정보를 요청하거나, 특정 질문에 대한 사실적인 답변을 얻는 데 효과적입니다.
      
      **Agent 기반 접근법 (AI 에이전트)**
      
      AI 에이전트는 주어진 목표를 달성하기 위해 환경을 인식하고, 의사 결정을 내리며, 행동을 수행하는 자율적인 시스템입니다. 에이전트는 RAG를 포함한 다양한 도구를 활용하여 복잡한 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 에이전트는 상황 변화에 따라 전략을 조정하고, 필요한 정보를 동적으로 검색하며, 장기적인 목표를 추구할 수 있습니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 여행 계획을 세우거나, 복잡한 연구를 수행하는 데 활용될 수 있습니다.
      
      **Agentic RAG**
      
      Agentic RAG는 RAG를 AI 에이전트의 추론 과정에 통합하는 접근 방식입니다. 에이전트는 RAG를 사용하여 필요한 정보를 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 다음 단계를 계획하고 실행합니다. Agentic RAG는 변화하는 상황에 더 잘 적응하고, 복잡한 문제를 해결하는 데 효과적입니다 [2]. 특히, AI 에이전트는 고정된 학습 데이터로 인해 환각, 오래된 정보, 지식 격차 및 보안 문제와 같은 어려움에 직면할 수 있는데, RAG를 통해 끊임없이 변화하는 데이터 소스에서 정보를 검색하여 이러한 문제점을 해결할 수 있습니다 [2]. Agentic RAG는 기존의 RAG 방식보다 더욱 동적이고 유연한 방식으로 정보를 활용할 수 있게 해줍니다 [3].
      
      **RAG vs. Agentic RAG: 사용 시점**

## 핵심 요약

RAG(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)는 정보 검색을 통해 생성 모델의 정확도를 높이는 데 중점을 두는 반면, Agent 기반 접근법은 RAG를 포함한 다양한 도구를 활용하여 복잡한 작업을 자율적으로 계획하고 실행하는 데 특화되어 있습니다. Agentic RAG는 RAG를 에이전트의 추론 과정에 통합하여 상황 변화에 더 잘 적응하도록 합니다 [3].

## 주요 발견 사항

*   전통적인 RAG는 미리 정의된 쿼리를 사용하는 정적인 워크플로우를 사용하는 반면, Agentic RAG는 실시간으로 프롬프트와 전략을 조정하는 자율적인 AI 에이전트를 활용합니다 [3].
*   Agentic RAG는 RAG를 추론 과정에 통합하고 쿼리를 개선하여 변화하는 상황에 더 잘 적응할 수 있도록 하는 더욱 동적인 접근 방식입니다 [3].
*   RAG는 주로 사실에 근거한 답변을 제공하는 데 초점을 맞추는 반면, AI 에이전트는 복잡한 환경 내에서 계획 수립 및 적응 능력을 제공합니다 [1].
*   전통적인 RAG는 단순한 쿼리 기반 작업에 적합하며, Agentic RAG는 복잡하고 다단계 프로세스에 더 적합합니다 [1].
*   RAG는 AI 에이전트 내에서 도구로 사용될 수 있으며, 이를 Agentic RAG라고도 합니다 [1].

## 상세 분석

**RAG (검색 증강 생성)**

RAG는 외부 지식 소스에서 정보를 검색하여 언어 모델의 응답을 향상시키는 기술입니다. 기존의 RAG 방식은 미리 정의된 질문을 사용하여 정보를 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 답변을 생성하는 정적인 프로세스를 따릅니다. 따라서, 간단하고 명확한 질의 응답 작업에 적합합니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 특정 제품에 대한 정보를 요청하거나, 특정 질문에 대한 사실적인 답변을 얻는 데 효과적입니다.

**Agent 기반 접근법 (AI 에이전트)**

AI 에이전트는 주어진 목표를 달성하기 위해 환경을 인식하고, 의사 결정을 내리며, 행동을 수행하는 자율적인 시스템입니다. 에이전트는 RAG를 포함한 다양한 도구를 활용하여 복잡한 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 에이전트는 상황 변화에 따라 전략을 조정하고, 필요한 정보를 동적으로 검색하며, 장기적인 목표를 추구할 수 있습니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 여행 계획을 세우거나, 복잡한 연구를 수행하는 데 활용될 수 있습니다.

**Agentic RAG**

Agentic RAG는 RAG를 AI 에이전트의 추론 과정에 통합하는 접근 방식입니다. 에이전트는 RAG를 사용하여 필요한 정보를 검색하고, 검색된 정보를 바탕으로 다음 단계를 계획하고 실행합니다. Agentic RAG는 변화하는 상황에 더 잘 적응하고, 복잡한 문제를 해결하는 데 효과적입니다 [2]. 특히, AI 에이전트는 고정된 학습 데이터로 인해 환각, 오래된 정보, 지식 격차 및 보안 문제와 같은 어려움에 직면할 수 있는데, RAG를 통해 끊임없이 변화하는 데이터 소스에서 정보를 검색하여 이러한 문제점을 해결할 수 있습니다 [2]. Agentic RAG는 기존의 RAG 방식보다 더욱 동적이고 유연한 방식으로 정보를 활용할 수 있게 해줍니다 [3].

**RAG vs. Agentic RAG: 사용 시점**

*   **단순한 쿼리 기반 작업**: 특정 질문에 대한 답을 얻거나, 간단한 정보를 검색하는 경우, 전통적인 RAG 방식을 사용하는 것이 적합합니다 [1].
*   **복잡하고 다단계 프로세스**: 여행 계획, 연구, 보고서 작성 등과 같이 복잡하고 여러 단계를 거쳐야 하는 작업에는 Agentic RAG가 더 효과적입니다 [1]. Agentic RAG는 상황 변화에 따라 전략을 조정하고, 필요한 정보를 동적으로 검색하며, 장기적인 목표를 추구할 수 있기 때문입니다.
