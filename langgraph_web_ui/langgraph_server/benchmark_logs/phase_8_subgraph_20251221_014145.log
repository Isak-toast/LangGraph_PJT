      Preview: Crewai vs. LangGraph: Multi agent framework comparison | Zams Integrations Customers Pricing Blog Login Login Get Started Get Started Technology April 19, 2025 Crewai vs. LangGraph: Which multi agent framework should you use? Yaagneshwaran Ganesh Objective feature comparison to help you decide - based on features, benefits, and ideal use cases. While there are different ways to build an AI agent from scratch, it’s great that you are taking the efficient approach of using multi agent frameworks. You’re probably here because you’ve shortlisted Crew ai and LangGraph and want to decide which one is right for you. You’re in the right place. In this blog, we will compare the two in detail - on their features, benefits, and ideal use cases, including how agents connect to establish communication and interoperability. To get started, we need to have a basic understanding of multi agent systems. So, let’s first get a few basics out of the way. Why do you need a multi-agent framework? As your AI systems scale and you add multiple agents with different capabilities, the complexity of these applications grow. As the complexity grows, you will need a structured environment that orchestrates the agent activities, including the technical steps and requirements involved in building agents. That is where agentic frameworks come in. Multi agent frameworks provide you with a foundational structure for developing autonomous systems, and define parameters and protocols to handle interactions between multiple specialized agents. These frameworks also incorporate agent actions, which are fundamental components within a node-based AI framework, facilitating the execution of complex tasks. An agentic application can significantly enhance user experience and system efficiency by streamlining user interaction through minimal input and adaptive responses. Single agent systems These systems are autonomous but rely on one agent to handle a wide range of tasks, like a jack of all trades. For example, here’s how it works when requested for a sales pipeline report: As you can see, one agent carries out a series of tasks to accomplish the requested outcome. Single agent systems are great for specialized tasks where the problem is well defined and the scope is limited. But as your environment and context evolves, they fall short. Multi agent systems Multi agent systems, on the contrary, consist of multiple AI agents working together to achieve common goals. Let’s look at the same example of requesting to email the sales report, and see how the multi agent architecture manages specialized agents to execute it. Instead of one agent accomplishing all the tasks, the tasks are broken down into smaller components where each agent specializes in a specific task – such as planning, integrating, analyzing, and more like a team of specialists working together, where each brings their unique expertise to the table. And because these AI agents can collaborate dynamically and run these tasks in parallel, they can tackle more complex problems where the environment is always changing and evolving. Multi agent interactions allow these AI agents to communicate within the system, monitor and debug in real-time, and handle handoffs efficiently, enabling dynamic workflows. The better you understand how these multi agents interact, the better you can optimize these systems and scale your operations, without worrying about bottlenecks or performance issues. And that’s exactly what multi agent frameworks help you with. Additionally, these frameworks give you a set of pre-packaged tools and features to help you quickly build any type of agent systems, be it knowledge oriented, process oriented or predictive. In short, agentic frameworks are the backbone of scalable, efficient and autonomous AI operations. With that said let’s get to the comparison. What is Crewai? It is an open-source multi agent orchestration framework, that helps you build multi agent systems, and integrate them wit

      ## Detailed Information
      CrewAI and LangGraph are both multi-agent frameworks, but they cater to different needs and expertise levels [3].
      
      CrewAI is designed with a focus on collaborative agent teams, emphasizing specific roles and communication strategies [1], [2], [3]. Its role-based, YAML-configurable approach allows for a faster initial setup [1], [3]. CrewAI's modular design separates agent creation, task definition, and process orchestration [1], [3]. This makes CrewAI a higher-level framework that is more user-friendly for beginners [1], [3].
      
      LangGraph, on the other hand, is a graph-based workflow engine suited for structured and resilient LLM applications [1], [2], [3]. Using LangGraph requires a deeper understanding of graph structures and state management [1], [3]. LangGraph provides more lower-level controllability and greater flexibility for complex workflows [1], [3]. LangGraph is fully integrated into the LangChain ecosystem [2], [3].

      ## 핵심 요약
      
      CrewAI와 LangGraph는 모두 멀티 에이전트 시스템 구축을 위한 프레임워크이지만, CrewAI는 협업 에이전트 팀 구축에 초점을 맞춘 사용자 친화적인 고수준 프레임워크이고, LangGraph는 복잡한 워크플로우와 세밀한 제어가 필요한 경우에 적합한 LangChain 생태계에 통합된 그래프 기반 엔진이다 [1], [2], [3].
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   CrewAI는 특정 역할과 소통 전략을 강조하는 협업 에이전트 팀 구축에 특화되어 있다 [1], [2], [3].
      *   LangGraph는 구조화되고 복원력 있는 LLM 애플리케이션을 위한 그래프 기반 워크플로우 엔진이다 [1], [2], [3].
      *   CrewAI는 역할 기반 YAML 구성 방식을 사용하여 초기 설정이 더 빠르다 [1], [3].
      *   LangGraph는 그래프 구조와 상태 관리에 대한 더 깊은 이해가 필요하다 [1], [3].
      *   CrewAI는 초보자에게 더 사용자 친화적이며, LangGraph는 복잡한 워크플로우에 더 유연하다 [1], [3].
      *   LangGraph는 LangChain 생태계에 완전히 통합되어 있다 [2], [3].
      *   CrewAI는 에이전트 생성, 작업 정의 및 프로세스 오케스트레이션을 분리하는 모듈식 디자인을 가지고 있다 [1], [3].
      *   CrewAI는 고수준 프레임워크이고, LangGraph는 더 낮은 수준의 제어 기능을 제공한다 [1], [3].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      CrewAI와 LangGraph는 모두 멀티 에이전트 프레임워크이지만, 대상 사용자와 제공하는 기능 면에서 뚜렷한 차이를 보인다 [3].
      
      **CrewAI:** CrewAI는 협업 에이전트 팀 구축에 중점을 두고, 각 에이전트의 역할과 소통 전략을 명확하게 정의하는 데 용이하다 [1], [2], [3].  YAML 기반 설정 파일은 간단하고 직관적이어서 빠르게 프로토타입을 제작하고 실험할 수 있도록 지원한다 [1], [3].  에이전트 생성, 작업 정의, 프로세스 오케스트레이션이 모듈화되어 있어 코드의 재사용성과 유지보수성을 높인다 [1], [3].  따라서, 복잡한 로직보다는 역할 분담과 협업이 중요한 시나리오에서 CrewAI는 강력한 선택지가 될 수 있다. 예를 들어, 고객 지원 시스템에서 각 에이전트가 특정 기술 분야를 담당하고, 고객의 문의를 적절한 에이전트에게 전달하는 방식으로 구현할 수 있다.  이러한 접근 방식은 초보자가 멀티 에이전트 시스템을 쉽게 구축하고 이해할 수 있도록 돕는다 [1], [3].
      
      **LangGraph:** 반면 LangGraph는 더욱 복잡하고 구조화된 LLM 애플리케이션 워크플로우를 구축하는 데 특화되어 있다 [1], [2], [3]. 그래프 구조를 사용하여 에이전트 간의 상호 작용과 상태 변화를 정밀하게 제어할 수 있다.  하지만 이를 위해서는 그래프 구조와 상태 관리에 대한 깊이 있는 이해가 필수적이다 [1], [3]. LangChain 생태계와의 완벽한 통합은 LangChain의 다양한 도구와 기능을 활용하여 더욱 강력한 시스템을 구축할 수 있도록 해준다 [2], [3].  LangGraph는 데이터 처리 파이프라인이나 복잡한 의사 결정 시스템과 같이 에이전트 간의 상호 의존성이 높고, 각 단계별로 정밀한 제어가 필요한 시나리오에 적합하다.  예를 들어, LangGraph를 사용하여 연구 논문을 분석하고 요약하는 시스템을 구축할 경우, 각 노드(에이전트)가 특정 단계를 담당하고, 이전 단계의 결과를 바탕으로 다음 단계를 수행하도록 설계할 수 있다.  따라서, LangGraph는 숙련된 개발자에게 더 많은 유연성과 제어 기능을 제공하지만, 학습 곡선이 가파르다는 단점이 있다 [1], [3].

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      CrewAI와 LangGraph는 각각 뚜렷한 장단점을 가지고 있으며, 프로젝트의 요구 사항과 개발자의 숙련도에 따라 적절한 프레임워크를 선택해야 한다.  빠른 프로토타입 제작과 쉬운 사용성을 중시한다면 CrewAI가 적합하며, 복잡한 워크플로우와 세밀한 제어가 필요하다면 LangGraph가 더 나은 선택이 될 수 있다.  두 프레임워크 모두 멀티 에이전트 시스템 개발의 가능성을 보여주지만, 실제 적용 시에는 성능, 확장성, 유지보수성 등 다양한 요소를 고려해야 한다.  특히, LangGraph의 경우 LangChain과의 통합이 강력한 장점이지만, LangChain 생태계에 대한 의존성이 높아진다는 점도 고려해야 할 사항이다. 궁극적으로, 두 프레임워크를 모두 경험해보고, 자신의 프로젝트에 가장 적합한 도구를 선택하는 것이 중요하다.

      • Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant advancements in 2024, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their applications
      • The concept of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) involves a collective of diverse LLM-based agents, each possessing unique strengths, collaborating to achieve a common objective efficiently. This approach has shown significant improvements by leveraging the collaborative and coordinated efforts of multiple agents and tackling tasks that exceed the capabilities of any single agent (Guo et al., 2024). The growing popularity of LLM-based MASs is based on the success in complex problem-solving [...] Merdan et al., 2013; Fortino and and, 2013). Several recent research endeavors have focused on the implementation of MAS based on LLM by combining the argumentative and reasoning power of LLMs with collaborative interactions among intelligent agents to enable complex problem-solving and dynamic simulations. These LLM agents in MAS such as MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), Camel (Li et al., 2024), AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), and AGENTVERSE (Chen et al., 2023) are able to break down tasks, explore [...] Recently revolutionized LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have revealed remarkable performance in a wide spectrum of language tasks, setting novel standards in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Naveed et al., 2023; Llanes-Jurado et al., 2024; Eberhard et al., 2024; Baabdullah, 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Yan et al., 2024).

However, with the continuous influx of new related works, the existing reviews struggle to capture them comprehensively. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these studies. We first discuss the definition of LLM-MAS, a framework encompassing much of previous work. We provide an overview of the various applications of LLM-MAS in (i) solving complex tasks, (ii) simulating specific scenarios, and (iii) evaluating generative agents. Building on previous studies, we also highlight several challenges and propose future directions for research in this field.

Victor Dibia, PhD Jan 02, 2025 43 2 15 Share Transcript I spent a good chunk of 2024 focused on multi-agent system s - contributing to AutoGen - an OSS framework for building multi-agent apps, and working on a book on the topic . A lot has happened! This post is an attempt to catalog some of the key events into themes, and a reflection on where things might be headed. The content here is likely subjective (my viewpoint on what was interesting) and is based on a list agent/multi-agent news items I curated over the last year. TLDR: Five key observations from building and studying AI agents in 2024: Enterprises are adopting agents, but with some caveats Teams are building &quot;agent-native&quot; foundation models from the ground up Interface automation agents dominated early commercial applications A Shift to Complex Tasks and the Rise of Frameworks Benchmarks reveal both progress and limitations 1. Enterprise Adoption of Agents in Products .. with Caveats Many enterprises and startups have adopted the term “agents” in products, describing them broadly at systems that act on a user’s behalf with the goal of saving the user time and avoiding tedious/busy work . Some examples below: Microsoft Copilot Agents : “These AI-driven agents assist users in performing a variety of tasks, working alongside you to offer suggestions, automate repetitive tasks, and provide insights to help you make informed decision” Salesforce Agentforce : “Agentforce is a proactive, autonomous AI application that provides specialized, always-on support to employees or customers. You can equip Agentforce with any necessary business knowledge to execute tasks according to its specific role“ Sema4.ai agents. Sema4 goes a bit further than other offerings in their claims - “&quot;RPA fall short when it comes to complex, knowledge-based work. They lack the ability to reason, make judgments, and adapt to real-world changes.” LinkedIn HR Assistant : “Starting today, recruiters can choose to delegate time-consuming tasks to Hiring Assistant including finding candidates and assisting in applicant review, so they can focus on the most strategic, people-centric parts of their job” An important caveat here lies in how the agents are implemented. Most deployments use an LLM as a thin wrapper/orchestrator that &quot;calls&quot; existing APIs as tools. In essence, this trend represents a shift from a less manual approach &quot; clicking fetch data, upload to Salesforce, and generate report buttons&quot; to a more streamlined approach &quot;saying generate report&quot; while an LLM-enabled pipeline handles the clicking. This is clearly the responsible approach - retaining the reliability of existing APIs while improving user experience by minimizing repetitive steps. It is also non-trivial, as ensuring reliable tool selection at production scale remains challenging. While this is still several steps removed from truly autonomous assistants (the holy grail of agents), it represents a first step toward that journey. Before - Separate apps and apis that users interact with to complete business tasks in products Trend : LLMs act as thin orchestration layers that translate natural language requests into multiple of API calls (minimizes clicks and intermediate tasks). 2. “Agent-Native” Foundation Models An interesting development this year was seeing teams build foundation models specifically designed for agency . What does this mean? Well, a good agent must do a few things well - reason through multi-step plans for tasks, act

Home Home In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, becoming more sophisticated and integral to various applications across industries. With the most recent updates being Apple Intelligence , GPT-4o , and Gemini . As we navigate through 2024, several trends in LLM bots are emerging that are poised to shape the future of artificial intelligence and its interaction with humans. Let’s dive into 10 key trends in AI for 2024 that are defining the landscape of LLM bots. 1. Hyper-Personalization Personalization has always been a significant goal for AI-driven services, but with advancements in LLM Chat GPT technology, we’re seeing unprecedented levels of customization. LLM bots are now capable of tailoring interactions to individual user preferences, behaviors, and needs with incredible accuracy. This trend is evident in customer service, where an LLM chatbot can recall past interactions and predict future needs, providing a seamless and highly personalized experience. Below is an example of personalization done in 2 steps with Teneo . 2. Multimodal Capabilities Traditionally, LLM bots have been primarily text-based. However, the latest models are now integrating multimodal capabilities, combining text, audio, visual data, and even sensory data to create a more comprehensive interaction experience. For instance, a customer service bot can now understand and respond to queries through voice, recognize emotions from facial expressions, and interpret images to assist users more effectively. This multimodal approach enhances the bot’s ability to interact in more human-like and intuitive ways, bridging the gap between digital and real-world interactions. 3. Ethical AI and Bias Mitigation As LLM bots become more ingrained in everyday applications, the importance of ethical AI practices has grown. There is a strong focus on developing models that are fair, transparent, and free from bias. Researchers and developers are investing in methods to identify and mitigate biases in training data, ensuring that LLM chat GPT systems make decisions that are equitable and just. 4. Enhanced Conversational Abilities The conversational abilities of LLM bots are becoming increasingly nuanced and sophisticated. Advanced models can now maintain context over long conversations, understand complex queries, and provide more natural and human-like responses. This trend is transforming industries such as mental health support, where an LLM chatbot can engage in meaningful dialogues and provide real-time assistance to users. 5. Integration with external APIs The integration of LLM bots with external APIs and other products is another emerging trend. By connecting to various smart devices, LLM chat systems can offer more holistic solutions. For instance, a smart home assistant powered by an LLM can control household appliances, provide weather updates, and even offer personalized recommendations based on user habits and preferences. Teneo has over 50 open sourced connectors with other software, and allows you to integrate your LLM with these. 6. Scalability and Deployment in Diverse Environments LLM bots are increasingly being designed for scalability and deployment across diverse environments, from small businesses to large enterprises. Advances in cloud computing and edge AI are enabling LLM bots to operate efficiently even in resource-constrained settings. This scalability ensures that businesses of all sizes can leverage the power of LLM chat systems to enhance their operations and customer engagement. 7. Improved Accessibility Accessibility is a key focus, with LLM bots being developed to cater to users with disabilities. Features such as voice-to-text, text-to-speech, and visual recognition are being enhanced to provide an inclusive experience. This

      ## 핵심 요약
      2024년 LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템 연구는 LLM의 계획 및 추론 능력을 활용한 자율 에이전트의 발전과, 특히 다중 에이전트 시스템(MAS)의 성장이라는 두 가지 주요 트렌드를 보여준다. 이러한 시스템은 다양한 LLM 에이전트 간의 협업을 통해 복잡한 문제를 해결하는 데 중점을 둔다 [1].
      
      ## 주요 발견 사항
      
      *   LLM은 계획 및 추론 능력 덕분에 자율 에이전트로 활용되고 있다 [1].
      *   LLM 에이전트는 대화형 에이전트, 임상 의사 결정 지원 에이전트 등 전문 분야로 다양화되고 있다 [1].
      *   역동적인 상호 작용 및 전체 프로세스 시뮬레이션을 포함하는 다중 에이전트 시스템(MAS)으로의 경향이 증가하고 있다 [1].
      *   LLM 기반 MAS는 공통 목표를 달성하기 위해 협력하는 다양한 LLM 기반 에이전트로 구성된다 [1].
      *   다단계 작업 분해, 계획, 도구 사용 및 멀티모달 상호 작용을 위한 내장 기능을 갖춘 모델이 최근에 발전했다 [1].
      
      ## 상세 분석
      
      LLM 기반 에이전트 시스템의 발전은 인공지능 분야에 상당한 영향을 미치고 있다. 초기에는 단순한 텍스트 생성 모델로 시작한 LLM이 이제는 복잡한 작업을 수행하고 다른 에이전트와 협력하여 문제를 해결할 수 있는 지능형 에이전트로 진화하고 있다.
      
      **자율 에이전트로서의 LLM:** LLM은 단순히 주어진 프롬프트에 응답하는 것이 아니라, 스스로 목표를 설정하고, 계획을 수립하고, 필요한 도구를 사용하여 목표를 달성할 수 있는 자율적인 에이전트로서의 잠재력을 보여준다 [1]. 이는 LLM의 강력한 추론 및 계획 능력 덕분이며, 다양한 실제 문제 해결에 LLM을 적용할 수 있는 가능성을 제시한다.
      
      **다양한 전문 분야로의 확장:** LLM 에이전트는 특정한 전문 분야에 특화되어 더욱 정교한 서비스를 제공할 수 있게 되었다. 예를 들어, 대화형 에이전트는 자연스러운 대화를 통해 사용자의 요구를 파악하고 정보를 제공하며, 임상 의사 결정 지원 에이전트는 의료 데이터를 분석하여 의사의 진단을 돕는 역할을 수행한다 [1]. 이러한 전문화는 LLM 에이전트의 실용성을 높이고, 특정 분야의 전문가를 보조하는 역할을 수행하도록 한다.
      
      **다중 에이전트 시스템(MAS)의 중요성:** 단일 LLM 에이전트로는 해결하기 어려운 복잡한 문제를 해결하기 위해 여러 LLM 에이전트가 협력하는 다중 에이전트 시스템(MAS)이 주목받고 있다 [1]. MAS는 각 에이전트가 특정 역할과 전문 지식을 가지고 협력하여 전체 시스템의 효율성과 문제 해결 능력을 향상시킨다. 예를 들어, 공급망 관리, 교통 제어, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 분야에서 MAS의 활용 가능성이 높게 평가되고 있다. MAS 환경에서 에이전트들은 서로 통신하고 정보를 교환하며, 협상 및 조정을 통해 공통 목표를 달성하기 위해 노력한다.
      
      **최근 발전 사항:** 최근에는 다단계 작업 분해, 계획, 도구 사용, 멀티모달 상호 작용과 같은 기능을 내장한 LLM 모델이 등장하여 에이전트 시스템의 능력을 더욱 향상시키고 있다 [1]. 다단계 작업 분해는 복잡한 작업을 더 작은 하위 작업으로 나누어 각 하위 작업을 개별적으로 처리함으로써 전체 작업의 효율성을 높인다. 계획 기능은 목표 달성을 위한 최적의 경로를 탐색하고 실행 계획을 수립하는 데 도움을 준다. 도구 사용 기능은 LLM 에이전트가 외부 도구나 API를 활용하여 필요한 정보를 얻거나 작업을 수행할 수 있도록 한다. 멀티모달 상호 작용은 텍스트, 이미지, 음성 등 다양한 형태의 정보를 처리하고 상호 작용할 수 있도록 하여 에이전트의 활용 범위를 넓힌다.

      • RAG vs Agentic RAG RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a method that combines information retrieval with large language models to generate answers. Here’s how RAG works on a high level: 1 - The model retrieves relevant data from data sources and then extracts it to a vector database from the pre-indexed model. 2 - Augment the prompts by retrieving information and merging it with the query prompt. 3 - A Large Language Model (like GPT, Claude, or Gemini) understands the combined query and [...] generates the final response. A traditional RAG has a simple retrieval, limited adaptability, and relies on static knowledge, making it less flexible for dynamic and real-time information. Agentic RAG improves on this by introducing AI agents that can make decisions, select tools, and even refine queries for more accurate and flexible responses.

      • Agentic RAG innovates the retrieval augmentation concept by broadening it from static, single-turn interactions to the multi-step context of autonomous agents. While RAG focuses on factual grounding, AI Agents provide planning capabilities and adaptability within complex environments. By integrating these two models, agentic RAG seeks to develop autonomous systems that efficiently navigate iterative decision-making tasks without experiencing hallucinations. [...] The motivation behind agentic RAG development stems from use cases that require context-aware generation and real-time actions. Examples encompass advanced robotics, legal advisory services, healthcare diagnostics, and ongoing customer service engagements.    In these contexts, merely retrieving relevant information is insufficient. The agent must analyze the information, assess its importance, determine a response, and potentially execute an action in a continuous feedback loop. [...] The retriever module is central to both RAG and Agentic RAG techniques. Two primary methods are traditional sparse vector retrieval (TF-IDF or BM25) and neural dense vector retrieval (incorporating techniques like DPR, ColBERT, or Sentence-BERT). Sparse retrieval methods are well-recognized, straightforward to manage, and perform reliably with short queries. In contrast, neural retrieval often excels in handling more complex queries and synonyms; however, it requires GPU resources for training
      • Agentic RAG is more dynamic. Here, the AI agent actively manages how it gets information, integrating RAG into its reasoning process. It’s not just retrieving; it’s refining its queries using reasoning, turning RAG into a sophisticated tool, and managing information over time. This intelligent approach allows AI agents to adapt much better to changing situations.  Key Differences: [...] RAG is a technique where an AI model retrieves information from a knowledge base before generating its response. This retrieval augments the generation process. Traditional RAG is like a quick lookup. The AI queries a knowledge base, retrieves information, and then generates a response. [...] From searching internal company documents to external databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows an AI agent to find and use dynamic knowledgeーdata that is constantly changing. Using an AI query engine, you can give your agents access to constantly changing data, both internal and external, and use reasoning to enhance agent accuracy and decision-making, helping them perform complex tasks reliably.  ## What’s the difference between RAG and agentic RAG?

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows AI agents to access dynamic knowledge by retrieving information from constantly changing data sources, improving accuracy and decision-making. NVIDIA provides tools and infrastructure, including the NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint, NeMo Retriever, and NeMo Agent Toolkit, to accelerate the development of RAG-powered AI agents and AI query engines. AI-generated content may summarize information incompletely. Verify important information. Learn more Ever relied on an old GPS that didn’t know about the new highway bypass, or a sudden road closure? It might get you to your destination, but not in the most efficient or accurate way.&nbsp; AI agents face a similar challenge: they often rely on static training data. This data is fixed at a point in time—while it was current when created, it can quickly become outdated. This limitation can cause problems in real-world use: Hallucinations: Agents might generate incorrect facts that sound believable. Stale Information: They can&#8217;t access the newest data or real-time updates. Knowledge Gaps: They may lack specific, private, or emerging information. Security: Data permissions may change over time, or previously available data can become confidential. Now, imagine a GPS that updates in real time, instantly knowing about every new road, every traffic jam, and every shortcut. That’s the power of dynamic knowledge for AI agents, and it’s revolutionizing how AI can respond to our ever-changing world. AI agents need access to dynamic knowledge Beyond simple chatbots, AI agents are sophisticated AI systems designed to operate on their own. As NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang described , AI agents are &#8220;information robots&#8221; that &#8220;perceive, reason, plan, and act.&#8221; They are built to understand problems, make plans, use various tools, and even understand different types of information, like text and images. An AI agent’s core capabilities include: Perceiving: Understanding their surroundings and the context of a situation. Reasoning: Breaking down complex problems and strategizing solutions. Planning: Creating step-by-step actions to achieve their goals. Acting: Executing tasks, often by using various digital tools. From searching internal company documents to external databases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows an AI agent to find and use dynamic knowledgeーdata that is constantly changing. Using an AI query engine , you can give your agents access to constantly changing data, both internal and external, and use reasoning to enhance agent accuracy and decision-making, helping them perform complex tasks reliably. What&#8217;s the difference between RAG and agentic RAG? RAG is a technique where an AI model retrieves information from a knowledge base before generating its response. This retrieval augments the generation process. Traditional RAG is like a quick lookup. The AI queries a knowledge base, retrieves information, and then generates a response. Agentic RAG is more dynamic. Here, the AI agent actively manages how it gets information, integrating RAG into its reasoning process. It’s not just retrieving; it’s refining its queries using reasoning, turning RAG into a sophisticated tool, and managing information over time. This intelligent approach allows AI agents to adapt much better to changing situations.&nbsp; Key Differences: Traditional RAG: Simple &#8211; query,

      • For instance, a user can ask the AI agent to share all the tickets marked as “Urgent” in a specific Slack channel. This requires the agent to—using RAG—identify these tickets in the project management system before going on to share them in the designated Slack channel.  ### Traditional RAG vs agentic RAG  In short, traditional RAG enables users to receive personalized answers to specific questions, while Agentic RAG lets users outsource certain tasks of varying complexity to an AI agent. [...] Your customers’ use cases might require specific agentic RAG implementations.  For example, if an AI agent needs to access data from a 3rd-party system and that system doesn’t support APIs (or at least the relevant endpoints), the AI agent would need to scrape the data from that application.  That said, this situation is likely few and far between. [...] Several 3rd-party solutions already let you implement internal or customer-facing agentic RAG use cases relatively easily.  Here are some examples.  ### Ema’s Employee Assistant AI agent  Ema, a universal AI employee solution, offers an “Employee Assistant AI” agent that lets users make all kinds of requests, such as submitting a vacation request.
      • The motivation behind agentic RAG development stems from use cases that require context-aware generation and real-time actions. Examples encompass advanced robotics, legal advisory services, healthcare diagnostics, and ongoing customer service engagements.    In these contexts, merely retrieving relevant information is insufficient. The agent must analyze the information, assess its importance, determine a response, and potentially execute an action in a continuous feedback loop.
      • Of course, traditional RAG still shines in simpler use cases: a documentation Q&A bot, a single-turn FAQ answer, or anytime you have a well-defined static knowledge base and straightforward queries. The overhead of an agent might not be worth it for a question like “What are the store hours?” — a single retrieval from an FAQ vector index and answer generation is sufficient. As developers, the goal is to match the solution to the complexity of the problem. [...] user for clarification if needed, look up the user’s account info via an API, and even proactively follow up. IBM’s example highlights that a traditional RAG is like an employee waiting for instructions, whereas an agentic system is more like a proactive team that “take initiative and solve challenges on their own”. In a multi-turn workflow, the agent can decide at each turn what the best course of action is — whether that’s fetching more data or executing a step. This leads to more intelligent [...] Not every problem warrants the complexity of an agentic approach. However, certain scenarios and use cases see significant benefits from Agentic RAG’s advanced capabilities:

That’s where agentic RAG comes in. Read on to learn how agentic RAG works, why it’s becoming increasingly valuable, and how real-world platforms support it. {{this-blog-only-cta}} Agentic RAG overview Agentic RAG is when an AI agent uses a RAG pipeline to perform a specific action or set of actions on your behalf. For example, a traditional RAG pipeline works as follows: 1. A user asks a question (e.g., “Give me the marketing team’s first names and addresses?”). 2. This question gets embedded (or converted into a vector representation) and a large language model (LLM) uses it to search for semantically-similar embeddings in a vector database. 3. The LLM can then use the embeddings it identified as context for generating an output. How a RAG pipeline can work when a user wants to find colleagues in the marketing team Agentic RAG will go a step further: Based on the user’s role and department, the AI agent can offer to take specific actions, like asking marketing for an update on a project that’s relevant to the user or adding these marketing colleagues to an upcoming meeting that requires their support. Agentic RAG can also involve asking an AI agent to take specific actions directly. For instance, a user can ask the AI agent to share all the tickets marked as “Urgent” in a specific Slack channel. This requires the agent to—using RAG—identify these tickets in the project management system before going on to share them in the designated Slack channel.

      ## 상세 분석
      
      **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
      
      RAG (검색 증강 생성)는 질문에 답하기 위해 정보를 검색하고 해당 정보를 사용하여 답변을 생성하는 데 사용되는 기술입니다. RAG는 대규모 언어 모델 (LLM)을 사용하여 검색된 정보를 기반으로 일관성 있고 관련성이 높은 답변을 생성합니다. RAG는 잘 정의된 지식 기반에서 정보에 접근하는 간단한 단일 턴 작업에 가장 적합합니다 [1]. RAG는 내부 데이터에서 빠르고 정확한 답변을 얻는 데 유용하며, 특정 질문에 대한 답을 찾기 위해 대규모 데이터 세트를 검색하는 데 적합합니다. 예를 들어, 고객 서비스 챗봇은 RAG를 사용하여 FAQ 데이터베이스에서 정보를 검색하고 고객의 질문에 답변할 수 있습니다.
      
      **Agent 기반 RAG**
      
      Agent 기반 RAG는 기존 RAG 프레임워크를 확장하여 계획 및 적응성을 통해 다단계 컨텍스트를 처리합니다 [5]. 추론을 활용하여 쿼리를 개선하고 정보를 동적으로 관리합니다 [5]. 이러한 접근 방식은 목표 지향적이며 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 작업이 필요한 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 적합합니다 [5]. Agent 기반 RAG는 동적 지식을 사용하여 정확성과 의사 결정을 향상시키며, 기존 RAG의 정적 데이터 의존성과 대조됩니다 [3]. Agent 기반 RAG는 에이전트가 여러 단계를 거쳐 문제를 해결해야 하는 복잡한 시나리오에 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 에이전트는 여행 계획을 세우기 위해 항공편, 호텔, 액티비티에 대한 정보를 검색하고 각 정보 조각을 기반으로 결정을 내려야 할 수 있습니다. 또한 Agent 기반 RAG는 데이터가 지속적으로 업데이트되는 환경에서 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 에이전트는 주식 시장 정보를 모니터링하고 실시간 데이터를 기반으로 거래 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다. Agentic RAG는 단순히 정보를 검색하고 응답하는 것이 아니라, 여러 단계의 추론과 계획을 통해 복잡한 작업을 수행할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.
      
      **RAG와 Agent 기반 RAG의 차이점**
      
      가장 큰 차이점은 RAG는 주로 정보 검색 및 답변 생성에 중점을 두는 반면, Agent 기반 RAG는 에이전트의 추론 및 계획 능력을 활용하여 더욱 복잡한 작업을 수행한다는 점입니다. 기존 RAG는 정적 데이터에 의존하는 반면, Agent 기반 RAG는 동적 지식을 사용하여 정확성과 의사 결정을 향상시킵니다 [3]. Agent 기반 RAG는 목표 지향적이며 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 작업이 필요한 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 적합합니다 [5].
      
      **언제 사용해야 하는가**
      
      *   **RAG**: 간단하고 단일 턴 작업, 빠르고 정확한 답변이 필요한 경우, 잘 정의된 지식 기반에서 정보를 검색해야 하는 경우에 적합합니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 특정 제품에 대한 정보를 제공하거나, 간단한 질문에 답변하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.

      ## 결론 및 평가
      
      RAG와 Agent 기반 RAG는 모두 LLM을 활용하여 답변을 생성하지만, 문제 해결 방식과 복잡성에서 큰 차이를 보입니다. RAG는 빠르고 간단한 정보 검색에 유용하며, Agent 기반 RAG는 더욱 복잡하고 동적인 환경에서 뛰어난 성능을 발휘합니다. 어떤 접근 방식을 선택할지는 해결하려는 문제의 복잡성과 요구 사항에 따라 결정해야 합니다. 특히, 에이전트의 계획, 추론, 그리고 외부 도구와의 상호 작용이 필요한 경우 Agent 기반 RAG가 더 적합합니다. RAG의 장점은 구현이 비교적 간단하고 빠른 결과를 얻을 수 있다는 점이지만, Agent 기반 RAG는 초기 설정 및 관리가 더 복잡할 수 있습니다. 따라서, 프로젝트의 목표와 리소스를 고려하여 최적의 방법을 선택하는 것이 중요합니다.

## 상세 분석

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**

RAG (검색 증강 생성)는 질문에 답하기 위해 정보를 검색하고 해당 정보를 사용하여 답변을 생성하는 데 사용되는 기술입니다. RAG는 대규모 언어 모델 (LLM)을 사용하여 검색된 정보를 기반으로 일관성 있고 관련성이 높은 답변을 생성합니다. RAG는 잘 정의된 지식 기반에서 정보에 접근하는 간단한 단일 턴 작업에 가장 적합합니다 [1]. RAG는 내부 데이터에서 빠르고 정확한 답변을 얻는 데 유용하며, 특정 질문에 대한 답을 찾기 위해 대규모 데이터 세트를 검색하는 데 적합합니다. 예를 들어, 고객 서비스 챗봇은 RAG를 사용하여 FAQ 데이터베이스에서 정보를 검색하고 고객의 질문에 답변할 수 있습니다.

**Agent 기반 RAG**

Agent 기반 RAG는 기존 RAG 프레임워크를 확장하여 계획 및 적응성을 통해 다단계 컨텍스트를 처리합니다 [5]. 추론을 활용하여 쿼리를 개선하고 정보를 동적으로 관리합니다 [5]. 이러한 접근 방식은 목표 지향적이며 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 작업이 필요한 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 적합합니다 [5]. Agent 기반 RAG는 동적 지식을 사용하여 정확성과 의사 결정을 향상시키며, 기존 RAG의 정적 데이터 의존성과 대조됩니다 [3]. Agent 기반 RAG는 에이전트가 여러 단계를 거쳐 문제를 해결해야 하는 복잡한 시나리오에 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 에이전트는 여행 계획을 세우기 위해 항공편, 호텔, 액티비티에 대한 정보를 검색하고 각 정보 조각을 기반으로 결정을 내려야 할 수 있습니다. 또한 Agent 기반 RAG는 데이터가 지속적으로 업데이트되는 환경에서 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 에이전트는 주식 시장 정보를 모니터링하고 실시간 데이터를 기반으로 거래 결정을 내릴 수 있습니다. Agentic RAG는 단순히 정보를 검색하고 응답하는 것이 아니라, 여러 단계의 추론과 계획을 통해 복잡한 작업을 수행할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.

**RAG와 Agent 기반 RAG의 차이점**

가장 큰 차이점은 RAG는 주로 정보 검색 및 답변 생성에 중점을 두는 반면, Agent 기반 RAG는 에이전트의 추론 및 계획 능력을 활용하여 더욱 복잡한 작업을 수행한다는 점입니다. 기존 RAG는 정적 데이터에 의존하는 반면, Agent 기반 RAG는 동적 지식을 사용하여 정확성과 의사 결정을 향상시킵니다 [3]. Agent 기반 RAG는 목표 지향적이며 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 작업이 필요한 복잡한 다단계 프로세스에 적합합니다 [5].

**언제 사용해야 하는가**

*   **RAG**: 간단하고 단일 턴 작업, 빠르고 정확한 답변이 필요한 경우, 잘 정의된 지식 기반에서 정보를 검색해야 하는 경우에 적합합니다 [1]. 예를 들어, 특정 제품에 대한 정보를 제공하거나, 간단한 질문에 답변하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.
*   **Agent 기반 RAG**: 복잡한 다단계 프로세스, 컨텍스트 인식 생성 및 실시간 작업이 필요한 경우, 동적 지식을 사용하여 의사 결정을 내려야 하는 경우에 적합합니다 [5]. 예를 들어, 여행 계획을 세우거나, 주식 시장 정보를 모니터링하고 거래 결정을 내리는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.

## 결론 및 평가

RAG와 Agent 기반 RAG는 모두 LLM을 활용하여 답변을 생성하지만, 문제 해결 방식과 복잡성에서 큰 차이를 보입니다. RAG는 빠르고 간단한 정보 검색에 유용하며, Agent 기반 RAG는 더욱 복잡하고 동적인 환경에서 뛰어난 성능을 발휘합니다. 어떤 접근 방식을 선택할지는 해결하려는 문제의 복잡성과 요구 사항에 따라 결정해야 합니다. 특히, 에이전트의 계획, 추론, 그리고 외부 도구와의 상호 작용이 필요한 경우 Agent 기반 RAG가 더 적합합니다. RAG의 장점은 구현이 비교적 간단하고 빠른 결과를 얻을 수 있다는 점이지만, Agent 기반 RAG는 초기 설정 및 관리가 더 복잡할 수 있습니다. 따라서, 프로젝트의 목표와 리소스를 고려하여 최적의 방법을 선택하는 것이 중요합니다.
